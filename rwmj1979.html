<h1>Capital in New Zealand Agriculture</h1>
<p class='center'>R.W.M. Johnson</p>

<p>The place of capital in agricultural expansion in New Zealand
has been largely neglected in the past. Part of the explanation
for this lies in the lack of adequate statistics - the
official series on capital expenditure on farms only started in 1965-66. Partly the explanation lies in the fact that
capital expenditure has been largely autonomous in the
agricultural sector and no assistance or encouragement was
thought necessary. In fact, investment is not strictly
autonomous in the full sense of the word, rather it is
generated from within the sector and occurs without making
an impact on the institutional framework providing capital
to agriculture generally. In part, anyway, this is because
the institutional structure is largely geared to financing
land purchase and not farm development and expansion per se.</p>

<p>As a result of the shortage of official statistics this analysis is largely based on the independent work carried
out at Lincoln College in the 1960's. Official statistics have been used, however, to bring the Lincoln work up to
date, and more recent observations are drawn from the Agroscope survey of farmer's capital expenditure carried out by Farm Market Index Ltd. These various sources provide data for the period from 1945-46 to 1978-79.</p>

<p>The paper first examines the historical pattern of capital
expenditure in New Zealand agriculture since the war and
develops a simple economic model of real net investment I
along the lines earlier published by Lincoln College. From
this examination certain conclusions can be drawn about the
pattern of investment in the post war period. Secondly, the
paper reviews the available evidence on the propensity to
invest in agriculture in New Zealand and the implications of
this for national policy-making. The paper concludes with a
discussion of present policy measures and needed developments
to encourage the right production response in line with
national objectives.</p>

<h2>l. Trends in Farm Capital Investment 1945-79</h2>

<p>The following discussion is based on the usual definitions
of capital investment in a system of national accounts.
Gross investment is all expenditure on capital goods by
agricultural firms in the fiscal period or March year.
Capital goods are durable goods which contribute to further productive effort.</p>

<p>2.</p>
<p>Net investment is the true increment of capital added to the national capital
stock in the given period. The difference between 
gross and net investment is thus true replacement 
expenditure or economic depreciation. It should be
noted that the Lincoln College data used is devised
from a concept of true economic depreciation and hence
the derived data on net investment is not comparable
with other data series based on Inland Revenue permitted
rates of depreciation.</p>

<p>Table l brings together the available gross investment data for the period 1945-46 to 1978-79. Up to 1968-69
the series is derived from estimates aggregating individual items of capital expenditure found in secondary
statistical sources. It is not a direct measure of capital investment. From 1969-70 the Statistics Department's
series of capital expenditure on farms is used - this
being a direct census of all farms in New Zealand. The
last published year of results of the official survey
is 1976-77. The remaining data is derived from a
random sample of farmers interviewed by Farm Market
Index Ltd. Their questions are modelled on the Statistics
Department's questionnaire.</p>

<p>Over the period under review the money value of gross
investment in agriculture has increased twenty fold. Over the same period product prices have increased by
five times, thus the real value of capital investment
has increased by a factor of four. There has been a
steady build up of investment in land improvements over
the years and also in additional farm buildings.</p>
<p>Investment in plant has fluctuated more over the years
and has shown marked price increases in recent years.
Since 1949-50, land improvement prices have increased
by six times and plant and machinery prices have increased
by eight times. As a result of these differential
price trends real gross investment in land and buildings
has doubled since 1949-50 while that of plant and
machinery has only increased by a factor of 1.33 over
this period. (Such comparisons do not take account of
changes in the technical efficiency of plant, only
changes in prices).</p>
<p>Some of this gross investment is for replacement purchases
only. The Lincoln College data has identified the share of total investment which is for replacement and
the same rules have been applied to the data since
1968-69. At the same time, the net investment series
I is converted to real terms by the use of the price
indices referred to in the previous paragraph. The
resulting calculations are shown in Table 2 along with the value of livestock employed on farms from the
Lincoln College data - <u>all at 1949-50 prices</u>. Graph 1
shows the trends in real net investment in Iand and buildings and in plant and machinery for the period 1945-46 to 1978-79.</p>
<p>
3.</p>
<p>It can be seen that net additional real investment in
land improvements and buildings built up very quickly
in the early post-war period reaching a peak in 1955-56, then plateaued somewhat before building up to a
further peak from 1960-61 to 1966-67. Thereafter there
was a rapid decline in real net investment reaching its
lowest level in 1971-72. Two good years then followed
and the subsequent years have tended to stabilise at
about the real level of the early 1960's. It is clear
that net additions to the productive assets have been
made in all the post-war years, but also that the
growth rate of the 1950's and 1960's has not been maintained into the 1970's.</p>
<p>
The real net investment pattern for plant and machinery is quite different. There was a very marked re-equipment
period after the war peaking in the years 1949-50 to
1952-53. Thereafter the additions to the stock were
very small through the late 1950's and the 1960's.
Some of this could represent delayed re-equipping as
there was a marked up-surge of net investment in plant
and machinery in 1971-72, 1972-73 and 1973-74. After
 this last year the pattern of the 1960's has re-asserted
itself. Thus from 1960 to 1970 there was apparently a
marked increase in the efficiency of plant use as
production kept on expanding with a fairly constant
stock of machinery. In the 1970's re-equipment showed
a reverse trend in efficiency and by the end of the
decade a stable ratio was being achieved.</p>

<p>From statistics of real net investment, it is possible
to proceed to estimates of the real capital stock
employed in agriculture. The Lincoln College statistics
establish a base year stock for land and buildings in
the 1966-67 season and that for plant and machinery in
the 1949-50 season. Given a base year, the time series of capital stock are generated by simply adding or subtracting the real net investment increments in every year. The results of this process are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p>The trends in real net investment discussed earlier can now be assessed against the total stock of capital employed. As Table 4 shows, the growth of land and buildings stock has been very steady over the seven five-year periods since 1945.</p>

<p>There has been some decline in the rate of growth of land and buildings stock in the two five year periods
since 1970, but growth nevertheless persisted. The fluctuations in the growth of the stock of plant and machinery are now much more apparent. Particularly so 1950 to 1955 and again, from 1970 to 1975. There was actually
a net decline in the plant stock between 1965 and 1970. Livestock shows the growth behaviour already well
known and documented. Such might be expected from a set of price weights as compared with a set of feed
equivalents!</p>
<p>4.</p>

<p>The strong contrast in the behaviour of land and building stocks and the livestock series since 1969 is illustrated
in Graph 2. Up to 1969 a strong association was evident between livestock expansion and the land and building
stock. After 1969 there is a complete break and this requires further examination.</p>

<p>The first question to ask is whether the statistical material can stand the burden being placed on it?
7 There is little doubt about the accuracy of the livestock
series, hence the construction of the land and buildings
series should be questioned. The gross expenditure
series is reliable, the price series are fairly reliable
but there is some doubt about the adjustments for
replacement of capital goods.</p>

<p>The average rate of replacement in the Lincoln series worked out at 1% of the real capital stock of land and
buildings up to 1969 and this has been assumed for the
period after 1969. If this 1% is an underestimate then
of course the growth of the stock series would be less.
It can be calculated that a replacement rate of 2.25% 
would cancel out the growth factor - hence further 
research is needed to see whether this factor can be more narrowly defined.</p>

<p>Secondly, it could be asked if there has been any structural change in capital investment in the 1970's?
The balance between land development and buildings
investment can be judged by examining the gross money
investment series in Table 1. It can be seen that up
to 1973-74 there was a rough equality between the
series. From that date onwards, however, building investment
has tended to increase relative to land improvement
investment. Given New Zealand's pastoral comparative
advantage, this last trend could well be one of the
explanations for the decline in the growth of production in
recent years. A further breakdown of recent data is shown in Table 5. New houses have increased slightly as a proportion of total building investment.</p>

<p>Thirdly, it may well be that the type of farming requiring new investment is changing. Statistics
Department data is available on gross investment trends by type of farming, though again these are not perfect
as the definitions of type of farming have been changed in the period concerned. Table 6 shows the main farm types which can be deduced from the Statistics presentation.</p>

<p>The sheep and beef sector has maintained a constant share of the total; the dairy sector has slowly declined,
especially since 1971-72; the crop sector has maintained a constant share except for the years for which data is
incomplete; market gardens have steadily increased their share (they are the only horticultural group for
which a continuous series is available), and the residual group of "other" has steadily increased its share.
This is partly due to the wider coverage of the survey and partly due to the growth of miscellaneous activities such as orchards, poultry farming, stud farming and plantations.</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Aggregate gross investment in these items has increased ten fold in the period from 1966-67 to
1976-77. It might be worth researching if these "other"
items have a higher component than average of buildings
investment rather than "land" investment.</p>

<p>All in all, there is a clear trend away from the pastoral sector, mainly due to the relative decline in dairy
investment, and a growth of the miscellaneous sector which includes horticulture and other activities as well. The evidence is not conclusive enough, however, to explain static production trends of itself.</p>

<h2>The Propensity to Invest</h2>
<p>Recent Government policy is best understood against a background discussion of the financial structure of the agricultural sector. This section of the paper therefore discusses the
financing of annual production and capital investment, the
relation between capital investment and net income and the
different stages of development which individual farmers can
pass through. The third section will discuss the evolution
of Government policy in recent years with regard to assistance
for capital investment in agriculture.</p>
<p>
In 1977-78 the total value of assets employed in New Zealand
agriculture, including live stock, was $11.5 billion. This
was made up as follows:</p>
<p>
<table border=0,summary='Assets New Zealand Agriculture 1977-78' class='c2'>
<tr><td></td><td>$(million)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Land and Buildings</td><td> 8 300</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Plant and Machinery</td><td> 1 500</td></tr>
<tr><td>Livestock</td><td> 1 760</td></tr>
<tr><td>Total </td><td>11 560</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There were some 60,000 full-time farm holdings employing
about 130,000 people in active production. There were thus
about $200,000 of assets per farm and $100,000 of assets per
person engaged.
</p>
<p>As already noted in the previous section some $357 million was spent in 1977-78 on <u>new</u> farm assets, either replacing old ones or adding new ones. Some $140 million was spent on
plant and machinery and $217 million on land and buildings.
In addition to these expenditures it is estimated that some и
$400 million was spent in 1977-78 on farm purchase, that is
largely but not completely on the financing of younger or
new farmers on to properties of their own. The balance of .
this money was spent on financing farmers into better
propositions, up the agricultural ladder, into semi-retirement etc.</p>
<p>
Leaving aside the financing of farm purchase, it is estimated that in 1977-78 some $3,000 million was spent in simply
financing annual production and investment on farms in
production. The details of this calculation are shown in an appendix to this paper.</p> 
<p>6.</p>
<p>The position can be summarised, however, in the following simple version of the estimates
made.</p><p>
<table border=0,summary='Cash Flow New Zealand Agriculture 1977-78' class='c2'>
<tr class=''><th colspan='4'>Cash Flow New Zealand Agriculture 1977-78 $(million)</th></tr>
<tr class='left'><td>Ingoings</td> </td> <td><td>Outgoings</td> <td></tr>
<tr class='left'><td>Sales of Product </td> <td>2,600 </td> <td>Materials</td> <td>1,610</td></tr>

<tr class='left'>
<td>Loans not for purchase</td> 
<td> 420 </td> 

<td> Wages<br/>Interest<br/> Tax<br/>Principal repaid<br/>Investments<br/>Living Expenses</td>

<td> 280 <br/> 190<br/> 130 <br/> 240<br/> 50<br/> 520</td> </tr>

<tr class='left'><td> </td> <td> 3,020</td><td></td> <td>3,020 </td></tr>
</table>

<p>Thus, some 86 percent of annual outgoings are financed from
the sale of product with only 14 percent financed by way
of a net increase in borrowing. (Only the net increase in
bank and stock and station borrowing has been-included in
the figures). On the outgoings side some 53 percent of the
inflow is spent on materials - this includes livestock
purchases, current inputs, and capital goods, but <u>not</u>
depreciation. The remainder is made up from wages of employees
(9 percent), interest on borrowings (6 percent), repayment
of principal (8 percent), taxation on previous years earnings
(4 percent) and general living expenses (7 percent). A
small allowance has been made for off-farm investment -
$50 million - there is very little reliable data on this
component.</p>

<p>At any one time the total amount of short-term credit is much greater than that shown. As at the end of July 1978
total trading bank term lending was $94 million, and as at March 31 stock and station agents, advances were $197 million
At the height of the growing season the amount would be greater
than this. The net change in the total advances to the
farming industry over the last two years are made up as
follows:</p><p>
<table border=0,summary='Loans to New Zealand Agriculture 1977-78' class='c2'>
<tr class='left'><td></td><td>1976-77 </td><td>1977-78</td></tr>

<tr class='left'><td >Rural Bank development loans </td><td>74.3 </td><td>132.3
<tr class='left'><td >Term loans </td><td>23.4 </td><td>7.5</td></tr>
<tr class='left'><td >Trading Bank advances</td><td> 58.8</td><td> 59.3</td></tr>

<tr class='left'><td >Proprietor's surplus </td><td>857.0 </td><td>614.0</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
7.
</p>
<p>Further examination of these statistics over a longer term
would reveal the underlying pattern of how the net change in
financing is relating to the general prosperity of the .
industry. Loan finance not only provides within season
working capital, and new investment capital, but also provides
a cushion in which year-to-year fluctuations in farming
income can be absorbed without calamitous effects both on
the standards of living of farmers and their investment
activities - the general objective 5f?this report.
The predominant feature of the financial system remains the
annual sale of product as far as farmers are concerned. In
the broader context, of course, their propensity to invest
will be coloured by their expectations as to future price 4
and volume trends as well as those of the immediate past. .
Further, their judgements will also be influenced by other
factors of a non-economic kind such as their perception of
their place in the total society, and the future of that
society as it affects them. </p><p>
The strongest economic factor, however, remains the availability
of finance out of current earnings. The statistical evidence
for this relationship is not particularly strong. Graph 3
shows the net national income in farming - or proprietors'
surplus as it is now called - for the period 1946 to 1978
compared with gross agricultural capital expenditure.
In the period up to 1972, when income fluctuations were much
smaller than in the 1970's, small adverse changes in net
income were scarcely reflected in changes in capital expenditure
e.g. in 1958-59 and 1967-68. In other years capital expenditure
was maintained irrespective of income changes. Since 1972,
capital investment has followed up the sharp increase
in the money value of incomes, with a set back in 1974-75
reflected in both series.</p><p>
V Another criteria for judging the propensity to invest is the
percentage of proprietors? surplus used for gross investment.</p><p>
In five year periods, the percentage has varied as follows:</p><p>
1946-47 ? 1950-51 21.3</p><p>
1951-52 ? 1955-56 28.5</p><p>
1956-57 - 1960-61 26.3</p><p>
1961-62 - 1965-66 29.4</p><p>
1966-67 - 1970-71 34.0</p><p>
1971-72 - 1975-76 31.4</p><p>
1976-77 - 1978-79 46.2</p><p>
Mean 28.9</p><p>
This therefore shows how investment levels rose relative to
income in the early 1950?s, fell off slightly in the late
1950?s, rose again through the whole of the 1960's, tended
to fall slightly in the early 1970?s as a whole, and then
recovered considerably in the late 1970?s. Since some of
the investment must be generated from the farmers? own income
there could be an inverse relationship between these two
series in some years.</p><p>

8.
</p><p>Finally the marginal propensity to invest from the above
data is shown in the following equations:</p><p>
Y = 37.8 + 0.44 X where Y = Investment</p><p>
R2= 0.86 X = Net Income</p><p>
DW= 0.93</p><p>
SE= 0.03
</p><p>
Further investigative work is required to define the independent
variables more appropriately, including distributed lags,
wider definitions of income, and other explanatory variables.

<h2>The Investment Cycle in Pastoral Farming</h2>
<p>As well as a high propensity to invest out of current income,
the investment process in pastoral farming is characterised
by a definite cycle of spending and profits. Some systems
of farming can be improved by small changes in husbandry,
technology and management, and the process of investment and
growth is smooth and scarcely perceptible. Pastoral improvement
in New Zealand, on the other hand, usually relates to fairly
large lumpy investment changes related to pasture development,
bush clearing, topdressing and livestock development. These
events take time to achieve a hence the pay back period is
relatively long term. Some recent estimates show payback
periods of 13-24 years depending on the vegetative cover to
be cleared. The investment process has the further characteristic
-that once started it has to be carried through to achieve
any results at all. If interrupted, most of the benefits
are lost. Expressed in terms of a series of costs and
returns over a period of years, the early years show up as a
period of cash deficits followed by a period of profit as
the investment matures. Graph 3 shows the typical pattern
that can be expected. To calculate the rate of return on
investment in these circumstances, some form of cash flow
analysis is required, such as discounting. In general the
long maturity period of this kind of investment requires
special encouragement and assistance if it is to be maintained
at levels consistent with the national interest.</p>
<h2>The Role of Government Assistance</h2>
<p>Traditionally Government played a major part in the land
settlement process in New Zealand and not in the land development
process. The legislation of the 1890?s breaking up the
larger rural estates was concerned with settlement questions
and not development. This was also true of the period of
soldier settlement after World War I. In contrast the
soldier settlement scheme after World War II combined both
settlement and development objectives. Properties were `
bought, developed and then settled. Assistance was provided
for further development. On the other hand, civilian settlement
through the State Advances Corporation was largely concerned
with financing purchase of farms right up to the mid 1960's.
But in 1978, purchase loans only formed 36% of total rural
lending by the Rural Banking and Finance Corporation which
took over from the State Advances Corporation in 1973.</p>

<p>9.</p>
<p>There is thus considerable evidence that has been expressed
 elsewhere that agricultural development in New Zealand is
largely autonomous in character. The theory is that the
pioneer ethic was largely responsible for the production
response in the past, hence government assistance could
largely be devoted to providing an institutional framework
which supported the desires of the migrant middle class who
aspired to own land and work it. Thus, Government provided
a straightforward land registration system, migration policies
which ensured an adequate labour supply, and a financial
system which ensured a settler could get a start in life.
The rest was left to hard work, enterprise and not a little
luck.</p>
<p>Events started to change in the early 1960?s. Static production
levels were identified at the end of the 1950's and led up
to the Agricultural Development Conference in 1963-64. This
led to two significant changes in policy. Allowable expenses
for tax purposes were extended to capital development A
associated with the land, but not buildings and machinery.
At the same time nil standard values were also introduced.
Secondly, new lending policies for the rural section of the
State Advances Corporation were introduced to encourage land
development. It can be seen that the tax concessions were
aimed at removing a disincentive to investment from the
plough-back of farm revenues and the development funding was
extending a principle already applied to the soldier settlement
schemes.</p>
<p>The 1970?s have brought a new government approach. The Livestock Incentive Scheme (L.I.S.) was introduced in the
1976 Budget which actually subsidised the development process
on pastoral farms. The intention again was to provide loan
money during the formative stages of development, but to
make it suspensory if certain expansion targets could be
met. Farmers could take a livestock loan or claim a tax
concession equivalent to double the grant provided. The
significance of LIS was that it extended the 1963 provisions
to those who did not pay tax as well as those that did.
The 1978 Budget extended the LIS principle to land development
in the Land Development Encouragement Loan Scheme. This
scheme again tackles the impediment to development posed by
the lumpy investment problem. Loans are provided on a
suspensory basis for development of land out of bush scrub
and tussock to a grass cover, up to a limit of $250 per
hectare.</p>
<p>The 1978 Budget also made new moves to provide more certainty
for farmers with long term development plans. This process
had been started by the 1976 reform of the price stabilisation
schemes where more concrete definitions of minimum prices
and levy procedures were introduced. The Supplementary .
Minimum Prices Scheme provides guaranteed prices for 2 years
ahead as near as possible to levels which will ensure reasonable
living standards for farmers.</p>

l0.
<p>The evidence available to date suggests that the assistance
provided in the last 3 years has markedly increased the
ratio of capital investment to net farming income, but has
not so far generated a positive increase in the volume of
production, particularly pastoral production. Further
analysis is obviously required on the production side of the
equation as the investment process is working well, but
results are needed. Programmes which achieve the best
results in the national interest should be pursued.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This paper has shown that significant increases in real
investment have taken place in recent years without a
corresponding increase in output. There is considerable
evidence for a diversification of capital away from the
traditional livestock sector, and some evidence that buildings
have increased as a proportion of total investment. The
evidence is not conclusive and further detailed investigation
is required.</p>
<p>The analysis of investment in plant and machinery has shown
that a definite cycle of replacement takes place in the New .
Zealand farm sector. It seems clear that high incomes
enable farmers to accelerate their rate of replacement of
machinery, and once this is achieved further rises in income
have no effect for some time until a new generation of
machinery is required. It was further deduced that the
efficiency with which farm machinery is used has been improving
during the period as large increases in output took place at times when net machinery investment was static.
The propensity to invest on New Zealand farms is closely
related to normal income limits on farms. By and large,
farmers rely on current earnings for their capital needs.
The proportion of aggregate net income used for investment
is high and has varied considerably in the period analysed.
In the 1970's the proportion has risen to very high levels.
The marginal propensity to invest out of current income is
also high in New Zealand agriculture and is estimated to be
about 45% of extra net income.</p>
<p>Government assistance to agricultural investment has taken a
number of forms in recent years. In the 1960's full tax
remission was introduced for land development expenditure
along with a system of nil standard values. This period
also saw a rapid expansion of state development lending. In
the 1970?s more direct assistance measures have been introduced
in the form of the Livestock Incentive Scheme and the Land
Development Encouragement Loan Scheme. These provide for
suspensory loans when approved development programmes are
 undertaken. Most recently, Government has introduced the
 Supplementary Minimum Price Scheme to offer farmers guaranted
prices for 2 years ahead. This`package of measures is
having a profound effect on rural investment and consequently
development at the present time.</p>


11
<p>Future policy should aim to consolidate the measures already
introduced. There is scope for considerable rationalisation
of agricultural development. Areas where gains could be
made include programmes for noxious weed control, programmes
for accelerated land settlement by young farmers, encouragement
of settlement of Lands and Survey development blocks, seeking
out development opportunities for state and private development,
and investigation of better techniques of land improvement.
At the same time it will be necessary to ensure that the
financial support structure for farming is adequately provided
for so that worthwhile projects are satisfactorily funded.
