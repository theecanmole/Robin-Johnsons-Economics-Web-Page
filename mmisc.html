<h1>Miscellaneous papers</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="ecost.html">Contribution to the food miles debate in New Zealand</a>. This
category contains a paper written
for the National Business Review for March 2, 2007, and a 
<a href="minfm.html">letter to and reply
from</a> the Minister of Agriculture on the same subject. The
position taken is that protectionist interests in New Zealand's
trading partners could take over the food miles debate and ask
their governments to introduce carbon levies on imports of food and
thus discriminate against New Zealand trade.</li><p>

<li>'Reforming EU Farm Policy: Lessons from New Zealand' (2001) 
<a href="http://users.actrix.co.nz/simonjohnson/iea.pdf">PDF</a> Occasional Paper 112,
Institute of Economic Affairs, London This 32-page essay was
designed to make the case for further deregulation of the Common
Agricultural Policy in a more international market direction. It
demonstrates how a small agriculturally exporting economy like New
Zealand can retreat from a fairly highly regulated environment to a
more open economy in the space of 10 years. There were some pains
of adjustment and Government help was required at crucial times.
The implications for trade reform are discussed in a final chapter.
In a book of the same title, published by the IEA, my essay is
followed by a commmentary by Richard Howarth, an IEA commentator.

<li><a href="rwmj1999a.html">'The Contribution of Agriculture to the National Economy of New
Zealand'</a> 1999 meeting of Australian Agricultural and Resource
Economic Society, Christchurch, NZ. This is polemical piece, eight
pages in length, deploring the lack of understanding of politicians
and administrators of the sources of productive efficiency in the
NZ economy. It was later reprinted in Agricultural Science, New
Series, Vol 12 (4), 1999, Carlton, Victoria. </li>

Comment on E.K.Bensah's review of <q>Trade Performance and
Commodity Dependence</q></a> (UNCTAD) EK Bensah reviewed this UNCTAD
report on the wto_forum@yahoogroups.com website in February 2004.
This paper is an abbreviated version of a review of the same report
I prepared in June 2004. The full version will be published in
early 2005. I discuss the implication of commodity trade reform on
African nations south of the Sahara with emphasis on smallholder
agriculture. Posted on the wto_forum website 20 Sept 2004.</li>

<li><a href="indep.html">Market Signals Gone Awry</a>, <i>The Independent</i> 5 April 2006, p8.
This is a letter to the Editor in response to an article
<i>Infrastructure Stuck in the Slow Lane</i> published on 8 March
2006. That article made the point that the country's roading
expenditure was half the proportion of GDP compared with the 1960s
and 1970s. My letter updates some earlier results of mine that were
published on 29 September 1999. In the period 1995-2002 capital
stocks employed by the energy sector rose by 5%, those of the
transport sector rose by 1% and those of the communications sector
rose by 57%. I question whether the national planning arrangements
for transport and energy are adequate in the face of the obvious
lack of investment in these two sectors.</li>
