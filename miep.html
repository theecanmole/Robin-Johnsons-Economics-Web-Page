<li><a href="rwmj2000m.html">The Role of
Political and Economic Institutions in Rural Strategy Formulation
and Implementation</a>. This is a 55-page study commissioned by the
Rural Development Division of the World Bank of how an
institutional approach to economic policy objectives could
illuminate problems of policy delivery in developing countries. The
approach is based on a transaction cost model of government
decision processes with emphasis on alternative institutional
arrangements. Three case studies are discussed, viz. European milk
policy; NZ wheat marketing policy; and the delivery of World Bank
services to Kenya.</li>

EU Farm Policy: Lessons from New Zealand (PDF)</a>.
Occasional Paper 112, Institute of Economic Affairs, London. <br/>
This 32-page essay was designed to make the case for further deregulation of the Common
Agricultural Policy in a more international market direction. It
demonstrates how a small agriculturally exporting economy like New
Zealand can retreat from a fairly highly regulated environment to a
more open economy in the space of 10 years. There were some pains
of adjustment and Government help was required at crucial times.
The implications for trade reform are discussed in a final chapter.
In a book of the same title, published by the IEA, my essay is
followed by a commmentary by Richard Howarth, an IEA commentator.

This 14-page paper discusses
how the transaction cost model of government decision processes
might be applied in democratic societies with examples from
marketing boards in Australia and NZ. Different institutional
models are considered in the policy formation process in government
institutions; these evaluations are not normally found in the
public domain.</li>

<a href="rwmj2000i.html">The Role of Institutions in Policy Formation and Delivery</a>. 
This 23-page paper, an invited paper at the Berlin 2000 Conference of
the International Association of Agricultural Economists (IAAE),
uses the transaction cost model of policy formation and delivery to
illuminate the impact of institutions on economic policy making.
Particular emphasis is given to the role of transaction costs in
international coordination between institutions, and the influence
of institutional reform on the provision of government services to
the agricultural sector.</li>

This 17-page paper was delivered to the Adelaide
meeting of the Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics
Society in January 2001. In the paper, I review the meanings given
to transaction costs, bounded rationality and Williamson's
feasibility test, particularly with application to governmental
administrative structures. Examples are given of changes in
governmental services in a number of countries inspired by
institutional reasoning.</li>

This essay is a contribution to a symposium organised by the Insitute of Policy
Studies, Victoria University, Wellington. The symposium was
concerned with evaluating the quality of policy advice given to
Government. The essay, looking in particular at the New Zealand
experience, examines whether the effectiveness of past policy
measures has been successfully monitored and evaluated, and
suggests provision be made for adequate monitoring and evaluation
in the future.</li>

<a href="rwmj2003b.html">The Evaluation of Economic Policy</a>. 
This paper was presented to the
2003 winter meeting of the NZ Association of Economists in
Auckland, June 2003.It repeats the plea for more ex post evaluation
of previous policy programmes and suggests that greater
encouragement of evaluation work could be supported by CEOs and
Ministers. A preliminary examination of techniques required and
training involved is presented.</li>

<a href="rwmj2004a.html">Public Choice: Further thoughts on the relations between 
Government and its Advisors</a>. Paper presented at 2004 Meeting of the Australian
Agricultural and Resource Economics Society, Melbourne, February
10 - 13. Taking a public choice point of view, this paper examines
the relationship between the political decision makers and the
economic advisors in government departments, using New Zealand and
Australian examples. The paper identifies continuing friction
between the two groups and a trend to greater restriction on the
views of the public service, not unrelated to the growth of
ministerial advisors in both countries.</li>
