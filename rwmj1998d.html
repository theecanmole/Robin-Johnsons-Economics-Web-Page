<h3>Introduction</H3>

<p>A new literature in agricultural economics has appeared in recent years
concerning policy delivery systems (PDSs) as opposed to policy
formation and political economy (Sandiford and Rossmiller 1996). The
new literature uses the structure/conduct/performance paradigm to
examine case study material from the point of view of effectiveness,
efficiency, enforceability and equity. The aim is to identify whether
policy programmes have been effective and to use the approach to
particularly identify whether problems are caused by the structures
set up or assumed to be in place or whether problems have emerged
from the way the programmes have been implemented (the conduct
paradigm).</p>

<p>In an earlier paper, the author has reviewed the new literature of the PDS
and its success or not in explaining some 17 case studies of
different policy programmes put forward by the respective authors
(Johnson 1998). In some but not all of the case studies the structure
paradigm provided an important explanation of the subsequent
performance of the programmes enacted by the respective legislatures
or governments concerned. This suggests that a particular policy
structure and conduct can in many cases be traced to the
institutional arrangements that were in existence in a particular
country at the particular time.</p>

<p>By institutional arrangements is meant the political institutions that
operate in a country including the structure of the parliamentary
system, the role of the bureaucracy, the role of political parties,
and any conventions concerning operational rules within the
government system. It also includes arrangements for the conduct of
commerce including attitudes to property rights, the rule of law, and
rules for the resolution of conflicts, as these also enter into the
formation and delivery of economic policy.</p>

<p>The economic literature on PDSs includes writings on public choice,
transaction cost economics and the new institutional economics. But
much of the evidence comes from the public management literature and
political science. The aim of this paper is to draw from these
literatures to explain problems in the delivery of agricultural
economic policy in different countries and to suggest lessons for the
future. The paper is not a treatise on political science!  Rather it
attempts to catalogue operational experience in a convenient and
summary form that would be of guidance to policy specialists in
international organisations and in governments who haven't done the
reading for themselves.</p>


<p>The paper first discusses policy institutions in representative systems of
government, and then variants of the system found in different
countries. It then discusses political economy approaches to
government decision making and focuses attention on delivery or
implementation aspects of policy programmes. The paper then develops
a transactions cost approach to policy delivery systems to identify
the key institutional parameters at work. Two case studies are
examined from this point of view. The paper concludes with an
assessment of the approach and its implications for the future.</p>

</p>
<h3>Government Institutions</H3>


<p>Policy institutions refer to the particular machinery of government which
controls the authority and the resources needed to sustain policy
programmes (Considine 1996, p 72.). They include the legislature, the
system of elections, the means of raising revenue, administrative
bodies and so on. Most of this paper is about how these institutions
work, how they interact with each other, and, above all, how they
affect the formation and delivery of policy programmes. Policy
institutions vary from country to country, so the discussion is
general than particular (see Figure 2). We will attempt to review
common strands in government institutions among different countries
in a way that  international experts, say, can usefully use in
preliminary thinking about the country they are about to visit. As
Considine puts it  <q><cite>..our inquiry ...needs to pay attention to the
evaluation of institutions, to understanding their limits as well as
the uses they have for settling, calming and improving social
interactions among actors in policy systems</cite></q> (ibid, p.73).</p>


<p>Figure 1 shows six main types of government policy institutions found in most
democracies, and key functions/processes within each. The legislature
is the body of elected representatives, and the executive is a small
group in charge of the day-to-day running of government business. In
most countries there are two houses of representatives - an upper and
lower house [UK], or a house of representatives and senate [US and
Australia].  Systems of elections for representatives vary from
country to country and are discussed further below. The appointment
of the executive can also be by different means - in the presidential
system [USA and France] the executive is appointed by the president,
while in parliamentary systems [UK, Australia, NZ, Canada etc], the
executive [or Cabinet] is normally drawn from the elected
representatives and dominant party (Figure 2). In the British system,
the elected president is replaced by the heredity Queen or her
representatives.</p>


<p>The parliamentary/presidential system is a centralised institution or
group of institutions which provide the means of government of a
country. The elected members represent the nation as a whole.  The
authority to govern is based on majority groups of elected
representatives usually drawn from the political parties.
Accountability is to the electorate at election time. The system
requires a dominant group to work effectively. This is usually the
political party with a majority of seats [first-past-the-post], or a
majority of votes [proportional representation]. In turn, the party
system imposes a group discipline on the members which protects the
executive from threat from within, but also allows individual members
to act independently of the electors who put them there.
Centralisation of powers enables parliamentary systems to perform a
greater range of policy making tasks than presidential systems, to be
capable of better policy choices, and to be able to make sure these
choices materialise as consistent programmes and outcomes (Considine
1996, p.76).</p>


<p>The executive is the body in the parliamentary system with the main
policy making role. The executive commands the majority party and the
house of representatives. The fact of their recruitment from among
the ranks in the legislature and their necessary subservience to the
collective interest of the Cabinet/executive means that they are more
apt to be like a board of directors than executive managers. This
generalist background makes members of the executive dependent upon
the supporting bureaucracy for policy advice and information. Even in
those cases where Ministers develop an expert personal staff to check
the power of their own bureaucrats, the bulk of policy development
and almost all the work of implementation and evaluation is done by
the public service departments over which the member ostensibly rules
(Considine 1996, p 76.). The relative power of the different groups is
discussed further below.</p>


<p>The work of a parliament is expressed in the form of new laws or amendment of
existing statutes. The functions of laws are to make customary rules
binding on the citizenry and to give administrators authority to act
in the name of the government. Most policy proposals have to pass
through a system of review and discussion before they are approved by
the house of representatives as law of the land. Exceptions are
executive decisions made without reference to parliament. The
initiation of policy proposals may reside in the bureaucracy in
meeting routine requirements, or may reflect political initiatives
promised at elections or in response to pressure groups. Such
proposals can be subject to intense internal scrutiny and not all of
them proceed to the next stage. Informal consultation with outside
interests might take place. The formal proposition involving the new
policy is presented to Parliament in the form of a Bill - in essence
a draft Act of Parliament. This is `debated' in the Parliament and
may be referred to a subcommittee of the House [a select committee]
for detailed consideration. Public submissions are taken at this
stage in the British system. The fate of the Bill is then decided by
the House - `reading a Bill'  with first, second and third stages.</p>


<p>Members of the parliament have to be re-elected on a regular basis -  the exact
time period required varies considerably.  The size of the Parliament
in terms of representatives is determined by infrequent
constitutional changes and it may consist of an electorate-based
membership, nominated members [based on total votes cast], or a
mixture of the two [mixed member proportional representation]. 
Elections are a lottery for politicians as the result can be swayed
by public opinion, the media, and external events for example. The
power of the voter is at its greatest at this time and decreases
sharply in between elections. The Westminster system has this
attribute as compared with the US system where access to
representatives is much more open. Different voting systems are in
place in different countries, mainly being variations of different
weighting systems for votes [proportional representation]. Elections
are very fluid times in terms of policy formation, as political
insecurity is at its greatest and alternative views and interests of
pressure groups are much more obvious.</p>


<p>The Budget is a significant institution of parliament in itself as most
constitutions require a financial accounting of the government's
activities to be brought out into the open. The Budget is largely
concerned with ongoing appropriations for government departments, but
is also a policy document as it might change the way the revenue is
raised [by taxes] or signal new policy approaches to an old problem.
By and large, the Budget sets the fiscal stance of a Government, so
that expenditure is matched by tax revenue or is funded by borrowing.
In Westminster systems, Ministers bargain in secret for a share of
the revenue. In the US the budget shares are debated in the two
houses of Congress who have to reach agreement on the allocations. 
There is a large variation between countries in the level of 
government intervention in the economy. Recent trends are in terms of
a reduction in involvement in the economy - fiscal conservatism
(Schwartz 1996).  Reasons for this are discussed further below.</p>


<p>Intergovernmental structures:  In some countries [Australia, Canada, USA, Germany],
there is a state or provincial parliamentary system in parallel with
the national system - federal parliamentary systems. In others [UK,
NZ, S. Africa], the national legislature is paramount and no
sub-level parliamentary system exists. Federalism leads to a sharing
of responsibility and a requirement for clearly defined areas of
responsibility. By and large, federal structures increase the number
of parties to be consulted and hence slow down the passage of
legislation and new policy [veto points]. Most countries also
delegate responsibilities to local government authorities with
[usually] clearly defined functions and duties. For example, schools
are a local responsibility in the UK but a national responsibility in
New Zealand.</p>


<p>There are also regional groupings of countries such as the European Union. The
EU has its own set of political institutions, set up by mutual
agreement [constitution making], and its ongoing policy programmes.
These programmes are administered in member countries [operational
institutions], which tend to have their own distinctive
structure/conduct/performance characteristics (Williams 1997).</p>
   

<p>The civil service:  The parliament/congress is a democratic meeting of
representatives of the people with a mission to meet the needs of the
nation as a whole and the safety and welfare of the individuals who
make up the nation. The functions of the parliament therefore require
a large army of support staff to service the parliament[s], man the
armed services, and administer the existing and new policy programmes
previously agreed upon. The more interventionist the government, the
larger the number of employees who directly come under the orbit of
the national authority. Some governments require government
departments to administer programmes, but others may utilise
stand-alone but tax-financed entities for regulatory purposes [US],
or state-owned enterprises which operate within their own revenues
(Horn 1995, pp 40,170). At the head of the civil service will be the
major `policy' departments, which specialise in advising the
executive and Parliament on different courses of action available to
them. Other support staff are responsible for drafting legislation,
running select committees, and co-ordinating the work of the
appointed representatives. As quite major enterprises and employer of
people, the bureaucracy has problems of efficiency and accountability
of its own which are discussed later.</p>

<h3>Variations
in the Representative System  </H3>
<p><BR>
</p>
<p>The above description is based mainly on the <i>party government
</i>parliamentary system. There are a number of variations in the
basic system found around the world based particularly on whether
they are presidential or parliamentary systems and on differences in
the use of coalitions and the rules which govern them. Weaver and
Rockman (1993) recognise four main systems which they call <i>modal
government types</i>.  These are respectively:  presidential systems,
party governments, multiparty coalitions and single party dominants
[Figure 2]. Their classification also identifies what they call
<i>secondary government types</i> and <i>facilitating electoral rules
</i>which identify coalition and minority party arrangements and
different representation arrangements. These classifications are
useful for two purposes; first, the reader can add his or her own
experiences to the list or add to the categories, and second, they
lead to further discussion [below] of decision making structures and
processes with regard to policy delivery. Some attributes [discussed
above] like federal systems of parliament do not lend themselves to
such classification and may be found in all the modal types. Further
details of the government types are found in the reference given.

<h3>Governmental decision making processes  </H3>
<p>In comparing presidential and parliamentary systems of representation,
Weaver and Rockman (1993, p.12) note that in parliamentary systems
the head of the executive is drawn from the legislature and is
dependent for continuation in office on maintaining the confidence of
the legislature. In separation-of-powers systems, the chief executive
is chosen independently of the legislature - usually by direct
election - and serves a fixed term of office. The chief executive can
neither dismiss the legislature and call for new elections nor be
dismissed by the legislature without cause. </p>

<p>In turn, the party system is strong in parliamentary systems but weak in
presidential systems<a class="f" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a>.
In the US in particular, representatives have more leeway to build a
<q>personal  vote</q> for themselves and are less liable to co-operate
with other representatives. Also in the US members of the executive
cannot be recruited from the legislature. In France they may but must
be replaced. In the US, Cabinet is weaker than in parliamentary
systems, and bureau heads look to Congress for guidance and support.
Finally, the lower level of party discipline in the US permits
greater public access to policy makers and hence puts pressure on
their representatives (ibid, pp.15-16).</p>
<p>

<p>Weaver and Rockman see a third and fourth tier of explanations for differences
between all the regimes identified in Figure 2 [Figure 3]. Decision
making structures and processes which vary across regimes include:
cohesion of the government ruling elites, existence of veto points
within government, stability of government elites, elite autonomy
from short-term pressures, and level of interest group access. Fourth
tier influences include: voting rules, judicial review, regionalism,
federalism, bicameralism, bureaucratic strength, political
conditions, socioeconomic and demographic conditions and past policy
choices.</p>


<p>From previous discussion it is clear that <i>party government systems</i>
have a high degree of cohesion within the executive and the
legislature, there are few opportunities for mavericks to veto a
policy proposal in progress, the executive tends to be stable between
elections, and the executive is generally inaccessible to interest
groups! This is compared with <i>multiparty coalitions</i>, where
elite cohesion is weaker, minorities may hold veto powers, the
executive may not last between elections, and the elite may or may
not be accessible to interest groups. In the <i>single party
dominance regime</i>, there is high elite cohesion, few veto points,
and high stability between elections! (ibid, p.18).</p>


<p>From the point of view of this review, Weaver and Rockman devote only a
small section to the <i>implementation of policy.</i> They are mainly
concerned with different capabilities to achieve chosen goals and
note that some governments perform tasks better than others (ibid,
p.445). The capabilities they isolate are: degree of policy
innovation, capacity to ignore short-term electoral losses, capacity
for priority setting and targeting resources efficiently, capacity to
co-ordinate conflicting objectives, restrictions on policy
implementation, ability to represent diffuse interests, ability to 
manage minor groups in coalitions, and managing for policy stability
(ibid, p.448). The first five are performed best by governments with
concentrated power, and the last three are performed best by
governments with decentralised power. Party governments have greater
control over implementation, while separation of powers governments
face greater risks in implementation of policies.  As far as
<i>effective implementation</i> is concerned:</p>

<p class='blocktext'>Concentration of power is .... important for implementation of a
government's objectives and programs once they have been decided
upon. The most obvious obstacle to effective implementation is
additional veto points in the implementation process, which are most
likely to involve third tier institutions such as sub-national
governments or courts. But first and second tier institutions affect
implementation as well by leading to policies that are either
more or less difficult to implement or more or
less stable. If executive-legislative conflict and intra-legislative
squabbles in separation-of-powers systems lead to either
<q>bidding-up</q> <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></sup> 
or <q>splitting the difference</q> in policy design, serious
implementation problems could result. Policies may also be adopted
without adequate funding. Party government systems, on the other
hand, run the risk that policies may be reversed before they can be
implemented. Political arrangements [notably single-party-dominant
systems and to a lesser extent coalitional ones] that feature both a
high degree of elite stability and a well-established consultation
process are likely to be most conducive to effective implementation
of government policies (ibid, p.457).</p>

<h3>Economic and political models of Government</h3>


<p>Against this simple structural description of government systems, economists
and political scientists have developed several alternative working
models that purport to explain how governments reach decisions,
which, in turn, determine the structure and intended conduct of
individual economic policies for agriculture or any other sector or
interest. From these it is possible to set  up a performance analysis
for testing the efficiency and equity effects of a given policy
programme. These working models are useful devices for country
analysts to understand organisational problems that are likely to
occur.</p>


<p>The public interest model:  In this model, the national interest is achieved by
parliament agreeing to legislation evolved from compromise and
bargaining among the elected representatives. National interest can
be broadly interpreted as the Benthamite `greatest good of the
greatest number' as seen in the eyes of the decision makers. Civil
servants [bureaucrats] provide independent advice to legislators, and
implement the policies that result from the political decision level.
A career civil service based upon expertise and non-political
appointments provides objectivity and freedom from partisanship. This
system is said to be modelled on the British Westminster system and
is found in most countries associated with the former British
Commonwealth.</p>


<p>The economic role of government in this framework is to introduce
policies that increase social welfare. The welfare maximisation
perspective sees government as an omniscient and benevolent dictator
(Swinnen and van der Zee 1993). Governments intervene in the private
economy where it fails to function properly in allocating and
distributing resources [`market failure']. The nation state can
produce goods, internalise social costs and benefits, regulate
decreasing cost industries, and redistribute income. In theory these
actions can redistribute resources to maximise welfare.</p>


<p>Randall (1987) notes the philosophical lineage of this model from Rousseau,
Marshall and Pigou. Its basic premises are that the true public
interest will be revealed in the political process; that programmes
to promote economic activity, to rectify market failure [to
internalise externalities], to provide public goods and merit goods,
and to promote equality of opportunity; all may be seen as enhancing
the general welfare; and that continued vigilance and effort are
necessary to ensure that government remains responsive to the public
interest.</p>


<p>The individualistic model [<q>public choice</q>]:  This model is based on the
idea that the nation state is not an organic body apart from the
collection of individuals comprising it, and that the central role of
economists is to analyse how efficiently government institutions
enable individuals to express and realise their preferences about
public goods, public services, and policies (Johnson, D.B. 1991.
p.11). In this view, bureaucrats have their own preferences and goals
which they can achieve by enlarging the size and budgets of their
agencies. Politicians can achieve their goals by being elected to
office and bestowing favours. Interest groups act on behalf of
individuals in getting favourable policies passed in the legislature.</p>

<p>This model postulates that government decision making is subject to pressures
from interest groups, lobbying, voting behaviour, as well as
self-interest. Decisions tend to reflect the respective power bases
of the participants. Randall (1987) notes the lineage of this model from the writings of Wicksell and Locke, as modified by
Buchanan (1987) and Tulloch (1983). It employs a restricted version
of the Pareto principle where any change that harms any individual is
not an improvement. All rights are assumed to rest with the
individual and to avoid anarchy, individuals rationally delegate some
rights to a central authority. The emphasis is on voluntary exchange
and freedom of choice; and on individual liberty. The cornerstone of
liberty is a set of complete, carefully specified, secure,
enforceable, and transferable property rights.</p>


<p>The resulting decisions made by government in this environment are said
to reflect the <q>private interest point of view</q>.  Outcomes are
determined by the respective power bases of the participants.
Interest groups can earn economic rents from their activities by
influencing political decision making. `Capture' of politicians,
agencies and civil servants is often observed<a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>


<p>Buchanan argues that it is inappropriate to apply maximising models to
government policy formation, as wider constitutional issues have to
be considered in such a process (Williams 1997, p.6). Policy acts are
a matter of social organisation and should be approached differently.
Given the ongoing nature of government policy making, economists
should consider the economic problems of government not as agents
seeking to maximise economic welfare but as arbitrators, seeking to
work out compromises between conflicting claims (Buchanan 1975). The
role of constitutions and rules is discussed further below.</p>


<p>Transaction cost models:  These models focus on how governments are and should be
organised. They deploy the rationality hypothesis and a theory of
transaction costs to explain how government organisations work. They
posit that effective public administration requires that transaction
costs be minimised in determining and pursuing society's goals
(Zeckhauser 1995). Legislators are regarded as self-seeking in their
use of legislation to increase their net political support (Horn
1995, p 13). Their opportunities are limited by a number of 
<q>transaction costs/q>. These are the time and effort it takes to reach
agreement on legislative refinements and any time and effort that
affected private interests have to subsequently devote to
participating in implementation and administration; political
uncertainty that the legislation will last; uncertainty that the
legislation will be administered as intended; and, uncertainty about
the distribution of private benefits and costs.</p>


<p>The legislators who are most likely to remain in power are those who are
most successful in overcoming these transaction problems, such as
those who are best able  to reassure their supporters that the
benefits of legislation will not be lost to administrators in the
implementation, or undone by subsequent legislatures (Horn 1995,
p.14). In this context, Horn draws on agency theory in his discussion
of <i>implementation</i> of legislation. As he sees it:</p>
<ol>
<li>the enacting coalition and its constituents must rely on administrative
agents 	to implement their arrangements - it must delegate to get
things done;</li>
<li>these agents do not necessarily share the objectives of the enacting
coalition 	and its constituents; and</li>
<li>it is very difficult to monitor these agents and create a system of
<i>ex post</i> 	rewards and sanctions that will ensure that they act
to protect the interests 	represented at enactment.</li></ol>


<p>These problems create agency costs - that is the costs incurred to induce
administrators to implement faithfully what was intended in the
legislature, and the losses legislators and constituents sustain by
being unable to do so perfectly. They include the costs associated
with selecting administrators and monitoring their compliance, the
costs of using <i>ex post</i> corrective devices [rewards, sanctions,
and legislative direction], and the cost of any residual
non-compliance that produces <i>a difference between the policy</i>
<i>enacted and what is implemented</i> (ibid, p.19). There are a
number of administrative mechanisms that legislators can draw on 
that minimise these costs: contracting out versus in-house delivery,
tax-funded bureaux [departments], non-profit tax-financed regulatory
agencies [as in the US], and revenue-earning state-owned enterprises
[as in the British system]. Each has its advantages and disadvantages
(ibid, pp.9,40,170). </p>

<p>Private interests have a definite interest in <i>implementation </i>(ibid,
p.13).</p>


<p>Legislators and their constituencies [Horn's term for private interests] are seen
	as engaged in a form of exchange. Legislators want electoral support
and 	constituents want private benefits - or to reduce the private
costs - of 	legislation. The amount of net electoral support
legislators receive from 	promoting a piece of legislation depends on
the flow of benefits and costs that 	private interests expect it to
generate over time. The implementation features 	of the legislation
bear on this calculus because private interests are sufficiently
	forward looking to anticipate how <i>decisions on implementation</i>
will affect the 	flow of benefits and costs. That is why there are
often heated disputes over 	decisions on matters like the scope of
delegated authority, the form of 	organisation charged with
implementation, and the <i>procedures</i> administrative agents must
adopt. These factors affect &quot;:who&quot; ultimately &quot;gets
what&quot; out of the legislation.</p>
 

<p>Thus the design of legislation reflects the interests of the different groups
taking part in the political process and this may well have little
regard for equity and efficiency considerations. Most important is
what Horn calls the <q>commitment</q> problem. The flow of benefits to
legislators is often much more immediate than the flow of benefits to
constituents (ibid, p 16). Constituents run the risk that present or
subsequent legislative coalitions might undermine the benefits of
given legislation. This is a problem for legislators because
forward-looking constituents will assess the durability of future
legislative benefits and costs and reflect that assessment in the
degree of electoral support they are willing to offer. Thus
legislators cannot guarantee constituents durable benefits but they
can make binding arrangements that might tie down future
legislators<a class="f" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a></p>.

<p>Constituents respond by seeking guarantees that these bindings will
be entered into at the design stage, if, and when they are consulted.</p>


<p>Choice of administrative instruments:  The transaction cost model suggests,
other things being equal, that the national interest would be best
served by governments choosing the most efficient instruments
available to accomplish any given policy objective (Trebilcock 1995,
p.25). The argument is that, whatever the policy objective, it ought
to be achieved at the lowest social cost: nobody gains by needlessly
dissipating resources. A set of axioms governing policy and
instrument choice behaviour includes:</p>

<ol>
<li>choosing policies that confine the benefits to marginal voters [those
whose votes count] and confine the costs to infra-marginal voters
[those who are 	strongly committed  to the governing party];</li>
<li>choosing policies that provide benefits in concentrated form and
impose costs in dispersed forms;</li>
<li>choosing policies that will secure the co-operation of the
bureaucracy;</li>
<li>choosing policy instruments that minimise real costs over time when
they fall on a small group; and</li>
<li>choosing policy instruments that bring benefits within the current
electoral cycle.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is said that these axioms <q>explain</q> the problem of a mis-match between policy
instruments and ideal policy objectives. Such mis-matching is
unlikely to be the random product of mistakes, ignorance or stupidity
on the part of collective decision makers, but in many cases is
likely to reflect systematic incentive structures that the community
has built into political institutions (ibid, p.27).</p>


<p>Institutional economics:  The models of institutional economics emphasise the
results of individual and co-operative attempts to solve problems
posed in a world of potentially large transaction costs. The new
institutional economics is said to be firmly rooted in a second best
world where the relative efficiency of institutional arrangements is
the concern. It acknowledges the importance of bounded rationality,
complexity and costly information, combined with opportunism (Murrell
1994). These lead to the emphasis on transaction costs and the
belief that there may be a variety of institutional arrangements
that reduce transaction costs successfully. If co-operative solutions
can be found, the emphasis on opportunism is decreased. If
satisfactory norms of behaviour can be agreed, transaction costs are
also reduced, in this view.</p>


<p>The literature emphasises the innovativeness of individual and collective
attempts to solve transaction cost problems. They apply equally to
private economic relationships as well as the political sphere, where
co-operative efforts can result in new political constructs aimed at
solving problems caused by poorly constructed property rights (ibid,
p 202):</p>


<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-left: 1.01cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
The picture emerging is one of complexity - arrangements or
institutions of enormous variety and complexity that have been
developed to solve the difficult problems that arise when economic
interactions are other than the simplest kind of spot transactions.
This picture does not give us the simplicity and harmony of the
Newtonian system that is echoed in general equilibrium economics, but
instead has all the complexity of a catalogue of the earth's ecology.</p>


<p>As Williamson states (1994, pp.171,193):</p>

<ol>
<li>	i. institutions are important, and they are susceptible to analysis;</li>
<li>	ii. the action resides in the details;</li>
<li>	iii. positive analysis [with emphasis on private ordering and <i>de facto</i>
	organisation] as against normative analysis [court ordering and 
	<i>de jure</i> organisation] is where the new institutional economics
focuses attention.</li></ol>

<p class='blocktext'>...Taking institutions seriously is the first step. Working out the
microanalytic 	logic of economic organisation is the second....my
argument is that the  institutional economics approach, especially
of a bottom-up kind, helps inform these issues.</p>


<p>Constitutions and institutional rules:  Constitutional economics is the application
of economic analysis to the selection of efficient rules and decision
making institutions (Johnson D.B. 1991, p 341). Constitutional
analysis recognises a difference between operational and
constitutional levels of decision making. The operational level
consists of decisions made within a given set of already existing and
broadly accepted constitutional rules. The latter include voting
procedures and means of raising the revenue. The constitutional level
is where the rules of the game are established including the rules
for the application of property rights. These constitutional rules
are thought to be established in an atmosphere of conceptual
impartiality because the future effects on individuals cannot be
foreseen. Once established, they change only very slowly, but
sometimes cataclysmically [the French Revolution for example 
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a>].
In between such times, individuals/corporates/governments operate in
a relatively unchanging environment and can make operational changes
in policies, revenue collection and so on [incrementalism].</p>


<p>Rules and conventions essentially make commerce and government easier to
conduct. Rules are a time-saving and efficient way of individuals
interacting (Johnson, D.B. 1991, p.345). Constitutional rules set the
conduct of operational rules and do not need to be changed in the
short term. In modern societies, characterised by multiple
interdependencies and externalities, growth and increases in the
standard of living have become increasingly dependent upon
establishing an institutional environment that provides the correct
signals, information and incentives to members of society. These
institutions of society guide everyday conduct.</p>

<p>The growth of trade and commerce is dependent on such rules (North 1987,
p 421). Modern societies have devised formal contracts, bonding of
participants, guarantees, brand names, elaborate monitoring systems
and enforcement systems to protect the individual but also to create
security and confidence in commerce
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

<p>North calls this a well-enforced and well-specified system of
property rights. He points out that the resources devoted to
transacting are large [although small per transaction] but the
productivity gains from trade are even larger. Governments have a
co-ordinating and facilitating role in providing the environment
where transaction costs of trade and commerce are
minimised and property rights secure and protected. In turn,
Governments can make international agreements that provide security
of contracts and protection of property rights that thus facilitate
trade.</p>


<p>Rules can be written [as in constitutions or international agreements] or
unwritten [as with common understandings between individuals]. The
conduct and performance of <i>public policy</i> depends on the extent
to which a Government can design, adapt or modify the written and
unwritten rules in its environment. Constitutional rules,
particularly, are difficult to change easily, but when they do
change, the changes to society may be quite profound. This appears to
be the case in Australia at the present   time as the Government
seeks to find ways to implement the Mabo decision - a question of
native property rights to land.</p>


<p>Rules are therefore important in the study of political institutions. They
characterise the institutions surrounding political decision making.
They help reduce transaction costs. They make policy formation easier
and more productive. They reduce reliance on negotiating skills on a
case-by-case basis in the presence of high transaction costs. They
provide opportunities for increased efficiency and hence general
welfare (Martin 1989, p 5). But they may increase litigation as they
can be appealed and reinterpreted through the Courts. Secondly, they
reduce uncertainty and promote solidarity between various
participants in the political process through the development of routines 
and standard procedures (Considine 1996, p.71). 
When these settled sets of rules and codes for governing
become fully acceptable, they form recognisable policy making and
forming institutions such as parliaments, parties and bureaucracies
as we know them. At their broadest, these institutions are any
standardised behaviours which are regularly represented throughout
the political or policy system that built up
over a long time:  <q>institutions accumulate historical experience
through learning. The results and inferences of past experience are
stored in standard operating procedures, professional rules, and the
elementary rules of thumb of a practical person</q> (Considine 1996,
p.71).</p>


<p>The importance of these means for settling and defining what has been
learned cannot be overestimated. Without them any social group would
be forced to keep rediscovering the simplest ways of organising
themselves and dealing with the common tasks of survival. As well as
being practical devices for solving routine problems, institutions
are the group's way of establishing priorities, fixing values, and
turning profound philosophical problems into simple routines. How
long the routine will hold is as important a question as asking what
function the institution itself performs (Considine 1996, p.72).</p>


<p>New public management: This refers to a different but not unrelated set
of ideas to public choice focusing on the introduction of better
systems of management in the bureaucracy (Boston 1991, p 8). 
Aucion (1990, p 116) refers to two separate paradigms of
government and management. The first is public choice theory which
focuses on the need to re-establish the primacy of representative
government over bureaucracy;  the second is managerial theory which
focuses on the need to re-establish the primacy of managerial
principles over bureaucracy. Managerialism is a set of ideas
emanating from sources external to public management <i>per se</i>,
namely the literature on private sector or business administration.
It stresses that the capacities of modern complex organisations to
realise their objectives can be enhanced by management structures and
practices that reduce bureaucrat procedures in organisational
systems.</p>


<p>The two paradigms are likely to introduce a measure of tension, even
contradiction, in their application to changes in organisation (<i>op
cit</i>, pp 125-6). Public choice sees politics as pervading management;
that is politics is present in both the formulation and the
implementation of policies. Managerialism sees politics as present
essentially in the determination of the basic values or missions, and
thus the policies, of an organisation. Thus, in one case, politicians
must <q>tame</q> the bureaucracy via a concentration of power in the
elected representatives, while, on the other, bureaucracy must be
freed of excessive controls especially on line managers. In the first
case, the perceived need is to eliminate the capture of the
bureaucratic organs of the nation state by groups that pursue their
narrow self-interest in order that elected representatives be able to
represent the public's interest in public policy; compared with
giving high priority to the responsiveness of bureaucrats to their
policy constituencies [policy capture].</p>


<p>Hood (1991) has identified the following components of the new public
management: professional management in the public sector, use of
standards and measures of performance, an emphasis on output
controls, a shift to disaggregation of bureaucratic units, an opening
up to competitive services, the introduction of private sector
management styles, and more stress on discipline and parsimony in
resource use. </p>


<p>These trends suggest a greater stress on management skills as opposed to
professional skills, greater accountability through measures of
performance, a shift from input controls to output controls, the
separation of commercial from non-commercial functions, a shift to
contracts and public tendering procedures, more flexibility within
departments, and cutting costs in the public sector. Many countries
and jurisdictions have embraced these procedures in recent years.</p>


<p>The policy advice and delivery system: So far we have referred to the
relationship between the executive and the bureaucracy as that of a
principal-agent. The altruistic model sees economic advisors [agents]
giving independent and objective advice, and political decision
makers [principals] making inspiring national interest decisions. The
individualistic model sees the executive and the bureaucracy as
competing forces with separate agendas, with the emphasis on
self-interest. By way of contrast, the actual relationship between
the executive and the bureaucracy is more likely to be characterised
by a mixture of duties and obligations with changing emphasis on
different aspects of policy making and direction.</p>

<p>In addition, the policy advice <i>process</i> itself is surrounded by
considerable uncertainty, and a clear-cut principal-agent
relationship is complicated by incomplete information in the
exchange, asymmetrical information supply, and uncertainty as to any
outcomes (Boston <i>et al</i> 1996). While the role of advisors is to
process the necessary information that decision making requires, and
put forward alternative courses of action that might be consistent
with the stated aims of the executive, the role of the executive is
to be seen to be acting in the national interest and meeting
any sectional interests they may represent. Uncertainty about the
ends of the policy proposed means that the process itself has to be
viewed as a probabilistic problem rather than a certainty one.</p>


<p>The passive view of economists as advisors is that they only have a role
in analysing the alternatives that face decision makers, and that
they should not impose their own values into the political decision
making process. It is pointed out that governments should define some
objective function in terms of multiple ends or goals of economic
activity, and economists should delineate what is possible and the
costs and benefits of each course of action in this view (Blaug 1992,
p 128). This is a technocratic view of the policy advice process.</p>
 

<p>The executive, or principal in this argument, may well have any number of
well-defined and not so well-defined goals. In economic terms these
are the preference functions of the executive and these may
articulate national interest concerns and/or private interest
concerns. Most commentators including Blaug believe that the
executive does not have a well-defined preference function, but is
more engaged in a constant search for a new preference functions as a
result of learning by doing.</p>

<p>Blaug says that any executive decision maker starts with on-going
activities and gradually begins to define his/her objectives in
the light of experience with actual policies. Political decision
makers do not try to get what they want, rather they learn to want by
appraising what they get. Means and ends are indissolubly related,
and evaluation of past decisions, or technical advice about future
decisions, have to serve this purpose (Trebilcock 1995, pp 24-29).
Thus decision making is disjointed as it is repeatedly reviewed in
bits and pieces [by different people]
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a>,
and it is incremental because it considers only a limited range of
policies that differ little from existing ones. Disjointed
incrementalism does not merely adjust means to ends but
explores the ends while applying the means, in effect choosing the
ends and means simultaneously (Braybrooke and Lindblom 1963)
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym"><sup>9</sup></a>.</p>


<p>Bureaucrats as deliverers/administrators of policy programmes have not been
studied in such depth. However, the transaction cost approach of Horn
<i>et al</i> [the Harvard University group] indicates that
legislators do have a choice of delivery institutions at the policy
formation stage, and that constituents are likely to be consulted as
to that decision's effects on them! Once the delivery structure is
decided, the buck passes to the delivery agent. The problem then
becomes one of conduct rather than structure, as administrative
details are unlikely to have been highly specified in the original
enactment<a class="f" name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In this area, bureaucracies have their own sets of rules and
conventions, which vary from country to country and institution to
institution, but which will probably be the guiding force in
determining the ongoing delivery of the enacted policy programme.
According to Sandiford and Rossmiller (1996), it is this conduct
stage which will primarily determine the resulting performance of the
policy in terms of the original aims. </p>
   

<p>This discussion is a very important one with regard to the argument being
developed in this paper. We have moved from a discussion of single
purpose models of government to a view of the government process as a
whole. The single purpose models explain various facets of government
activity, but they do not adequately explain the total activity of
the government system at any one time. The central idea of disjointed
incrementalism is thus an attempt to generalise about public choice
theories, transaction economics, and agency theory <i>as a whole</i>
and yet learn from the process so as to better understand the policy
delivery structures that were envisaged in the first place. </p>


<p>To sum up, Figure 4 shows the so-called <q>iron triangle</q> of the
political, bureaucratic and private interest groups, and the
institutional functions of each that are addressed in part by the
theories of government described above. As far as policy delivery is
concerned, the most important parameters are those concerned with
policy design and implementation. The structure set up at the
outset to administer the policy proposal [new instruments or
modifications of old ones] is very much a political decision, subject
to legal and administrative advice. The actual conduct of the policy
from that point passes into another group's area of responsibility.
Here, as Figure 4 makes clear, a different set of functional goals come into play with a potential to
modify the original intentions.  The civil service is not without
self-interest, in the sense that it is involved in administering the
policy, monitoring its effects and reporting back [feedback]. This
feedback loop, which is the more important one, at least in
parliamentary systems, sets up further principal-agent conflicts over
the success or not of the policy programmes. The
recipients/clients/customers of the policies, or the private group
interests and individuals [constituencies according to Horn], have
clear cut private interests at heart. The interesting observation
that Horn comes up with is that they also have a feedback loop both
with regard to instrument design at the early stages of a policy
initiative, and with regard to ongoing reporting of the success of
the original policy proposal. </p>

<h3>Case studies revisited  </H3>

<p>The role of institutions in policy delivery can now be re-assessed. I have
fuller information on the studies of EU milk policy and NZ wheat
policy (Williams 1997, Sandrey and Reynolds 1990, Nixon 1993). We
need to focus on the transaction cost implementation model with
respect to: aims of the enacting legislation, consultation at the
enactment phase of the legislation, choice of instruments, conduct of
the delivery agents, and performance in terms of  the original aims.
We conclude with discussion of the role of institutions in policy
delivery. </p>


<p>With regard to the aims of EU milk policy, Williams (1997, p.107) states :
</p>
 
 
<p class='blocktext'><cite> <q>The performance criteria are here being used <U>endogenously</U>:
the focus of attention is a judgement of how effective and efficient
the policy and its delivery system is in fulfilling its <i>stated
aims</i>. Many discussions of the CAP [especially those emanating
from the UK] usually implicitly adopt a marginalist approach in which
judgement is passed on the system in relation to what the writer
<i>believes</i> would be the outcome of a free-market situation. Such
discussions frequently dismiss <i>the aims</i> of the policy without
discussion and never consider the policy delivery system.
Nethertheless, the policy exists to fulfil the requirements of
Article 39 of the Treaty, which remains in the original form and as
such is part of &quot;the economic constitution&quot; of the 15
member states. Moreover, the narrower aims of the policy legislation,
particularly as stated in the articles of 804/68, remain the law of
the EU. The EU has an agreement with the contracting parties of the
GATT:  this may require fundamental modifications to the milk policy
but not to the Treaty, as Article 39 is not currently on the agenda
of the Inter-Governmental Conference for the revision of the
Maastricht Treaty. Therefore the analysis of milk policy... considers
the policy in relation to its aims and does not question the aims
themselves. (italics in original)</q></cite></p>
 

<p>Consultation at enactment stage: The milk policy is determined by the European 
Commission in Brussels; the interests of the different original
members of the Union had to be taken into account in drafting Article
39. The producer interests are very powerful in France and Germany in
particular, and the enactment owes a lot to them though Williams does
not specifically say so in his study, but states (ibid p.20 ):</p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>
Around the central process of Community decision making through its
principal constitutions there is considerable opportunity,
particularly in agriculture and the dairy sector, for the activities
of pressure groups and &quot;industry experts&quot; [usually the
representatives and employees of powerful organisations in the
industry]. Farmers' unions are represented in Brussels through the
activities of COPA [Committee of Agricultural Producer's
organisations in the EC] and co-operative marketing organisations are
represented through COGECA [the general Committee for Agricultural
Co-operatives in the EC]. The dairy trade also has a European
organisation, [EDA - formerly ASSILEC] the European Dairy
Association, with representatives in Brussels. Each of these bodies
is able to obtain representation on the Commission's Milk Advisory
Committee, and through this channel farmers and industry marketing
organisations can exercise influence on proposals to be made to the
Council as well as on the implementation of policy by the Commission.</q></cite></p>


<p>Choice of instruments: The author does not discuss alternative instruments that
might have achieved the CAP's' aims. The problems met in formulating
the common policy for milk are referred to as follows (ibid, p.31):</p>
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>It took the original Six members of the Community
eleven years to achieve a common policy for milk and the other major
commodities of cereals and beef. In the milk sector each member state
had differing levels of protection for milk producers and different
methods of achieving it. In Germany and the Netherlands the liquid
milk market and the manufacturing or industrial milk market were
separated with elaborate methods of pooling prices between the two to
obtain the producer price. In order to establish free trade within
their borders the Six had to harmonise support prices and
intervention measures, eliminating border taxes and controls between
themselves in transitional steps, and establish a common level of
tariffs on imports of dairy products from third countries in matching
steps.  Export refunds had to be established and harmonised <i>pari
passu</i>. The transitional system introduced a mechanism with a set
of intra-Community levies on trade to be gradually eliminated in a
series of steps as external tariffs and internal intervention
measures were harmonised. Agreement in this process was achieved by
the gradual alignment of the level of protection afforded by measures
in the highest-price country.</q></cite></p>


<p>Conduct of delivery agents: The Williams paper is a <i>tour de force</i> in
its discussion of the implementation of the milk policy in the
different member countries of the EU. There is a three tier system of
implementation :</p>


 
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>....at the first level are the Community institutions that are
involved in policy making and objective setting, as well as in the
implementation process. At the second level are the institutions of
national governments [15 of them] each having some flexibility,
albeit limited, in operating the system. At the third level are the
marketing agencies who are responsible for their own strategies in a
competitive market, and are affected by the normal factors in a
market Structure-Conduct-Performance relation of investment,
economies of scale, product differentiation, advertising and brand
loyalty, research and development, and consumer demand for dairy
products.</q></cite></p>
 


<p>The different attitudes of the bureaucracies in member states to quotas
have given rise to much variation in milk prices (pp.77, 109):</p>
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>
...the amount of variation in the system throughout the Community is
very considerable. ....At one extreme, the Republic of Ireland has
generally had the lowest price with prices sometimes below 90 per
cent of the Target Price i.e. below the intervention milk equivalent
price. At the other, Italian producers have had prices estimated to
be as high as 130 per cent of the Target Price...Ranges of this
magnitude and variability could not reasonably have been said to have
been the intention of the original designers of the policy who sought
to eliminate variations that might occur through any arrangements
that would protect local liquid milk prices. Explanations of price
differences are complex and may relate to many structural differences
between countries, the size of the processing/marketing organisations
and economies of size, product differentiation, brand loyalty, and
the management and ownership of marketing organisations.</q></cite></p>


<p>Performance in terms of original aims: Williams finds that the <i>average</i>
target prices achieved from 1989 to 1995 over the 8 member countries 
were very near to that aimed for but that there was marked variation
between countries [as discussed above]. He notes average farm incomes
have risen from 1978/79 to 1990/91 while the target price measured in
ECUs moved very little. He attributes the positive structural changes
which have taken place to the quota system and assistance for
<q>outgoers</q>. Most member states have succeeded in keeping to within
one per cent of their national reference quantities in most years.
There are also other comments on efficiency, enforceability and
equity, which generally suggest that the original aims of the policy
are being met.</p>


<p>Summary: this study presents a sympathetic and positive view of the EU milk
policy which is broadly seen to be carrying out the aims originally
enacted. By separating the delivery of the policy aims from the aims
themselves, the author brings a new focus to the conduct and
performance of a given policy initiative. He concludes that to be
effective, analysts should always start with the aims and objectives
of given policies and recognise that when they have been absorbed
into a hard-fought-for constitutional agreement [the Treaty] they
will be very hard to change indeed.</p>


<h3>The demise of the New Zealand [NZ] Wheat Board  </H3>
<p>Marketing boards are legislative instruments set up to control fluctuations in
prices and production ostensibly in the interests of producers. They
are common in Australia and New Zealand though now being gradually
phased out. The NZ Wheat Board was established in 1965, in a process
of consolidation of previous market interventions with powers, not
unlike those of EU milk policy, to balance production and imports of
wheat, determine farmers' prices, determine milling and manufacturing
margins, and to recommend the price of bread to Government.   In the
discussion that follows, the Government of NZ is taken as the
principal, the Wheat Board is the agent responsible for administering
the policy, and the constituents are the wheat producers, the private
millers, the private manufacturers using flour, wholesalers and
retailers selling products with flour ingredients, and consumers. The
same questions are asked of the original sources.</p>


<p>Aims of the enacting legislation: The NZ Wheat Board was set up by Act of
Parliament in 1965 to rationalise and co-ordinate wheat production
and imports and regulate the prices and quantity of flour. The Board
was required:</p>

<ol>
 
<li>to control the acquisition and marketing of wheat and flour generally;</li>
 
<li>to encourage wheat growing and the use of wheat grown, having
regard to the best use of land available, the cost of imported wheat,
conservation of overseas funds, and other relevant considerations;</li>
 
<li>to ensue that adequate supplies of wheat and flour were
available; and</li>
 
<li>to promote and organise the orderly development and greater 
efficiency of the wheat and flour milling industries.</li></ol>


<p>Consultation at the enactment phase of the legislation: There was a considerable
history of intervention before 1965. A wheat purchase board had been
created in 1933 with power to purchase all wheat and fix prices to
the growers and millers, but not on imports. In 1936, a Wheat
Committee was formed to take over sole responsibility for the buying
and selling of all wheat, including imports. Price controls were
introduced in 1939 for the wheat, flour and bread sectors. In 1962, a
Commission of Enquiry was instituted and it recommended the
consolidation of the existing arrangements, including price control,
in a new enabling Act. A commission of enquiry approach suggests that
interested pressure groups were fully consulted in the public process
of consultation, though the sources are silent on the design aspects
of the legislation itself [In practice, in the NZ parliamentary
system, legislation is framed by the bureaucrats and interested
parties have only limited access, but access nethertheless, at the
Select Committee stage of a Bill.] </p>


<p>Choice of instruments: Again the two sources do not discuss alternative
instruments that might have been available at the design stage
(Sandrey and Reynolds 1990, Nixon 1993). Documentation of alternative
instruments discussed at the time would be hidden in departmental
archives. It is significant that both sources mostly document needed
changes to the legislation after the legislation was no longer
fulfilling its aims. They do not analyse whether the original aims of
the legislation were met in the intervening period! </p>


<p>Conduct of the delivery agents: The NZ Wheat Board administered the legislation
from 1965 to 1987 and from 1980 had to meet an increasing number of
regulatory changes introduced by the Government. The documents
consulted rather indicate that the Board as the Government's agent
was faithful to the aims laid down for them but that external events
overtook them (Sandrey and Reynolds 1991, p.127):</p>
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>
The key decision concerned the purchase price of wheat from farmers,
a price set to recoup all Wheat Board costs, as this subsequently
triggered other decisions such as the consumer price of flour. Each
flour miller was paid the calculated cost of processing wheat into
flour. These costs were independently calculated for each mill,
leaving millers with limited commercial interest in the price of
wheat. Indeed the only Board members who had a strong commercial
interest in the price paid for wheat were the farmers. The Board
maintained a pricing policy designed to encourage domestic production
of wheat and, therefore, self-sufficiency.</q></cite></p> 



<p>Prices: The sources are not precise on the course of producer prices, import
replacement prices and prices of alternative enterprise products
during the Board's administration. It appears that Australian wheat
could be landed in NZ more cheaply than equivalent NZ grown wheat in
most years and that pastoral products [especially lamb production]
were competing for the same land
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym"><sup>11</sup></a>.
The Board was thus forced into large imports of Australian wheat [up
to 100,000 tonnes in some years] to meet its adequacy commitments. </p>

<p>In the event, the Government removed price control on bread in 1980,
introduced a producer price based on a three year average of landed
Australian prices in 1981, abolished flour, bran and pollard price
control in 1984, and eventually required that the Board cease trading
in 1987.</p>


<p>Performance in terms of  the original aims: The original aims were focused on
producer welfare with the system being driven by producer price
negotiations with Government. One commentator stated (Ali 1993):</p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>It was very much a supply driven system, emanating from the growers,
whereas consumers were largely tamed by regulations.</q></cite></p>


<p>The legislation was enacted in a period when intervention in markets was
highly fashionable among politicians and bureaucrats. The interesting
feature of the legislation is that a once-removed marketing agency
was chosen to administer the policy, which, in other areas, was
carried out in administrative departments. The Board consisted of
representatives from Government [including the chairman], and
industry representatives from producers, millers and bakers. The
Board was handicapped by its charter with its emphasis on encouraging
domestic wheat growing which the Board interpreted as promoting
self-sufficiency (Nixon, p.23). Finally the Board had to negotiate a
producer price with the farmers' interests that still required
approval by Ministers. The conclusion must therefore be reached that
it was the structure that was at fault and not the agency
administering the policy. This is, of course, contrary to the views
given in the documents and the popular view of events in the period
concerned. But it does confirm the Williams view that policy delivery
must be examined in its context, and not judged out of context!</p>


<p>Without regulation of prices and margins, there has been a reduction in the
farmers' interest and an increase in the power of the millers and
bakers. The position of the millers and bakers has been enhanced by
amalgamation and take-overs and increased market power. The system is
now driven by quality considerations in both grain and flour and by
baking techniques. The price system is driven by international prices
and competitive forces within the industry. The quality and diversity
of products has increased considerably (Nixon 1993).</p>

<h3>Concluding observations<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym"><sup>12</sup></a></h3>
<p>The major problem with a review of this sort is to encompass a wide enough set
of institutional experience to make generalisation possible. This
review is more of a framework for further analysis than a full
testing of the general hypothesis.</p>


<p>While the viewpoint of agricultural policy implementation has been adopted,
the analysis should be robust enough to cover a wide range of
economic policy experience. This is the value of James Q. Wilson's
comparative work on the behaviour of bureaucracies.
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>The test is whether transaction cost theory <q>explains</q> what happens
in different countries and parliamentary systems? The evidence
reviewed suggests that policy making and implementation is a
political process where information and expected effects on
constituents are important considerations, and that these
characteristics are fairly universal across countries and
parliamentary systems. </p>

<p>For country economists in international organisations, there is thus a
need to apply these principles and collect comparative information on
different political constitutions and their workings.</p>


<p>The primary lesson to be learned is to evaluate past policies in their
own context. The institutional/structural design of a policy is
important. The relationship between the legislators and the
constituents [to use Horn's terminology] has an effect on design and
implementation. Bindings made on  successors and on implementers may
be introduced to improve the acceptance of the policy. At this stage,
alternative policy instruments will be considered. It is in this
sense that <q>institutions</q> are most important in the evaluation of
policy initiatives.</p>


<p>The main theoretical support comes from transaction cost economics as applied
to public administration. This could be regarded as part of, and
consistent with, the new institutional economics. What are the policy
attributes that bring the different actors together? What impediments
have to be overcome? How do the actors work together to find
solutions? How lasting is the legislative design? Are monitoring
processes set up and so on?</p>


<p>From the author's experience within the agricultural bureaucracy in a
single-house party-parliamentary system [New Zealand], the task of <i>ex
post </i>policy evaluation is a job most civil service organisations
should be engaged in but very often are not! Judgements on the need
for change in a policy programme may come from both the political
clientele and/or the bureaucrats who manage it. The information
balance is heavily weighted in favour of the bureaucrats, especially
where they have monitoring systems in place. In forming policy
proposals, the economist's contribution is diluted by other
generalists and legal people who actually write the parliamentary
bills.  The bills themselves are then subject to political
compromises which further confuse the original economic aims. The
choice of instruments is extensively debated by bureaucrats but may
be changed in the final decision making process after further
political consultation. A pure economic approach is not possible.
Thus the institutions of government in New Zealand were characterised
by a narrow distribution of power, party government, few veto points,
a low level of consultation and review, and a responsible but dutiful
bureaucracy
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym"><sup>14</sup></a> 
[prior to 1996]. Policy proposals therefore tended to be passed
relatively quickly but also changed frequently. Since 1996 coalition
government has raised the number of veto points and raised the level
of consultation; policy formation and agreement is now much slower. </p>


<p>The New Zealand system might be compared with Australia in this respect. In
1973, an Industries Assistance Commission was established, on the
recommendation of Sir John Crawford, to advise the Federal Government
on assistance which should be given to, or withdrawn from, industries
in Australia. Crawford identified the following reasons for
establishing the Commission (Uhrig 1983, p.4):</p>
<ul>
<li>	 assist the Government to develop policies for improving the allocation of
	resources among industries in Australia;</li>
<li>	 provide advice on those policies in an independent and disinterested manner; and</li>
<li>	facilitate public scrutiny of these policies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Commission was to report back on matters referred to it but could
also initiate enquiries under certain circumstances. The Commission
later became the Industries Commission and then the Productivity
Commission. While the focus was on the need for industry assistance,
there is an implication in the aims of the legislation that the
implementation of the policy and the suitability of the instruments
should be assessed. After reporting back, the Commission's input
becomes part of the central government's decision making system and
wider departmental and political programmes become influential
<a class="f" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>

<p>As in most party parliamentary systems, the design of legislation is
an internal matter where initial proposals are modified and
reformulated to meet the needs of the participants in the political
market place. In Australia, this is a complex process due to a
two-house system of federal parliament and 5 state parliaments which
make for a slow policy-making process (H Plunkett, pers com). Thus
the institutions of government in Australia are characterised by a
wide distribution of power, party government, active veto points, a
high level of consultation and review, and a responsible but dutiful
bureaucracy.</p>

<h3>Annex 1: Policy Review Procedures in New Zealand Government System</h3>


<p>1. Departmental: Until recently there were no formal requirements [but
see 2 below]. Cabinet papers making new proposals or proposed
adjustments to previous legislation required a background statement
of previous enactments and cross-references. The reasons for change
should emerge from such a statement. Design of instruments should be
addressed if relevant. Consultation was not mandatory [but see 2
below]. Background papers based on a form of
structure/conduct/performance are optional but are not a requirement.
Background papers may be contracted out. Ministers seldom involved in
formal consultation, but Select Committees of the House of
Representatives may call for submissions on legislative enactments.</p>


<p>2. Regulatory Impact Statements <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym"><sup>16</sup></a></sup> :
As of July 1 1998, all policy proposals submitted to Cabinet which
result in government bills or statutory regulations must be
accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Statement, unless an exemption
applies. The Statement should consistently examine potential impacts
arising from government action and communicate the information to
decision-makers. Completion will provide an assurance that new or
amended regulatory proposals are subject to proper analysis and
scrutiny as to their necessity, efficiency, and net impact on
community welfare. The Statement should contain the following
information:</p>
<p>a. a statement of the nature and magnitude of the problem and the need for
government action;</p>
<p>b. a statement of the public policy objective;</p>
<p>c. a statement of <i>feasible options</i> [regulatory and/or non
regulatory] that may constitute viable means for achieving the
desired objective(s); </p>
<p>d. a statement of the <i>net benefit</i> of the proposal, including the
total regulatory costs [administrative, compliance, and economic
costs] and benefits [including non-quantifiable benefits] of the
proposal, and <i>other feasible options</i>; and </p>
<p>e. a statement of the <i>consultative programme</i> undertaken. </p>
<p>[presumably the statement of net benefits could be followed up in an <i>ex post</i>
sense at a later date and comparisons made]. </p>


<p>3. The Audit Office <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym"><sup>17</sup></a></sup> :
The Audit Office exists as a constitutional safeguard to maintain the
financial integrity of New Zealand's parliamentary system of
government. The Audit Office, as an Office of Parliament, is
independent of the executive branch of government. The Office's role
is to assist Parliament to strengthen the effectiveness, efficiency,
and accountability of the instruments of government. This role is
discharged by providing reports on whether public sector
organisations operate, and account for their performance, in a manner
<i>consistent with Parliament's intentions</i>. The outcomes sought
are that Parliament and the public will be confident that public
sector organisations are: <i>delivering what they have been asked to</i>;
have operated lawfully and honestly, and have not been wasteful; and
have fairly reported their performance in their statements of account
(italics added). </p>


<p>4. The Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit:  Crown companies are
fully owned registered companies subject to the Companies Act 1993
but where the shareholding is still held by two Ministers of the
Crown. The Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit (CCMAU) was
established in 1993 to ensure that the investment is performing to
the best of its ability, to collect information on performance of the
companies, and to provide advice to Ministers. CCMAU is an
independent unit attached to the Treasury department. CCMAU's
approach is to maximise the performance of the individual companies
in which the Crown has an ownership interest.. To meet this objective
from a company-level perspective, CCMAU focuses on:</p>
<p>a. the formation, structure, investment and continued ownership of
individual companies,</p>
<p>b. business strategy and the associated risks and opportunities,</p>
<p>c. ensuring the most qualified directors are recommended for
appointments,</p>
<p>d. performance, in absolute terms, against benchmarked companies,</p>
<p>e. the impact of government policy and regulation on individual comanies or
groups of companies, and</p>
<p> f. innovation, best practice and continuity of essential services (CCMAU
1998).</p>

	James Q. Wilson, a political scientist and professor of Government
	at Harvard, has written widely on the behaviour of government
	agencies (Wilson 1980, 1989). In the earlier book he sets out to
	examine whether regulatory agencies in the US were subject to
	capture and motivated by self-interest. The broad questions he asked
	were: how were goals determined, how was conflict resolved or
	managed, how were standards set, and how was policy enforced? He
	identifies that it is the distribution of costs and benefits from a
	given policy proposal that shapes its design and implementation
	particularly with regard to interest groups (ibid, pp.366-370). In
	the latter book, he asks why agencies behave as they do, how
	government works, and how do they interpret their mandate? After a
	wide-ranging discussion including the German army, Texas prisons and
	Atlanta schools, he notes that the critical tasks are different in
	each case and so the organisations differed in culture and patterns
	of authority, but all three were alike in one sense: incentives,
	culture and authority were combined in a way that suited the task at
	hand (ibid, p.365). The examination of the mandates of the agencies
	is more implicit than explicit in these books but the general thrust
	is highly consistent with the application of the conduct paradigm
	discussed in this paper.</p>

	information that will be supplied to Parliament, and amendments to

	These observations do not apply to countries with a civil code.
	Civil codes arising out of the Napoleonic reforms in France tend to

	order to protect the state. A civil code is resistant to reform.
	Effects on governance and commerce include high direct transaction
	costs, inflexibility, slow speed of transactions, the need to resort
	to the courts to resolve conflict, and a low low level of
	effectiveness and efficiency of litigation (Sandiford and

	understanding.  The model adopted by Blaug, and used here is the
	incremental change and low understanding model.  Decisions with
	incremental change and high understanding can be dealt with by the
	administrators; but decisions with large change, with low or high
	understanding, are not easily explained by the B&amp;L approach.

	Similar processes are carried out by the Australian National Audit

	implementation and alignment with professed objectives, but are not
	critical of policy <i>per se</i> (H. Plunkett, pers com.). Regulatory
	Impact Statements are mandatory for all Commonwealth legislation or
