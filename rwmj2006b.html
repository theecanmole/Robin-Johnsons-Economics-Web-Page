<p class="abstract">For the last decade and a half agricultural research in New Zealand has been
dominated by Crown Research Institutes.  The four key institutes
AgResearch, HortResearch, Crop Research and Landcare research took
over the responsibilities formerly carried out by the Department of
Agriculture and the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.
The major reform of the public research system in New Zealand was
part of wider reform of the old civil service structure of science in
favour of a corporate structure of research institutes which bidded
for funds from a newly created agency called the Foundation for
Research, Science and Technology. At the same time the Government
changed many of the existing priorities for public investment in
research with more emphasis on private investment, complementary
funding, and new opportunities. These rules tended to reduce the
funds made available to the agricultural institutes as they were
among those mostly heavily dependent on public investment. In the 15
years since the reforms took place these institutes have lost about 3
percentage points of the total sums, public and private, available
for all research, and have lost about 9 percentage points of the
public funds available. They have made up the latter losses by more
contracting and partnerships with the private sector. In 2005, we
report that the agricultural research interests have coordinated a
combined approach to Government to review the system of priorities
and to help raise the total level of investment in agricultural
research.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As a country, New Zealand has a strong export oriented agricultural
sector. While only 5 per cent of GDP is generated in the farm sector,
farm-based exports form 55 per cent of total merchandise exports.
Productivity growth in the agricultural sector is also one of the
highest in the country. Forbes and Johnson (2004) have shown that
total factor productivity in the sector grew at the rate of 2.47 per
cent per year from 1972 to 2003. Productivity per unit of labour has
grown at 3.03 per cent per year as the labour force has not expanded
over this period and productivity per capital unit has grown at 1.44
per cent per year as the amount of real capital employed per labour
unit has nearly doubled. These productivity increases are
significantly related to organisational and technological
improvements in agricultural production systems over this period. In
a country like New Zealand these changes must be underpinned by a
sound and productive research and development (R &amp; D) sector.
Harrington (2005) claims <q>The relatively high productivity growth
in the primary sector has been driven by research and development
(coming up with new ideas), innovation (practical application of
those new ideas) and economies of scale</q>. Past research investment
is clearly important but productivity has also been strongly
influenced by changing patterns of production, particularly in
response to the removal of government induced distortions.</p>

<p>In this paper, we first discuss the evolution of the institutional
structure of the R &amp; D sector over the last two decades and how
this has affected the agricultural research sector. This involves a
discussion of what was called the <q>New Zealand Science Model</q> a
development of the <i>New Public Management</i> and <i>Public Choice
theory</i> (Boston et al 1996). We then discuss developments in the
agricultural research sector and how these have interacted with
Government priorities for research and the funding available. 
Finally we consider leading issues that have arisen over 15 years of
science reform and the current position of the protagonists involved.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Agricultural Research in New Zealand</h2>

<p>Despite significant spending on environmental research and via the
New Economy Research Fund, New Zealand still spends a high proportion
of its public R &amp; D investment on agricultural research. Investment
in different sectors varies according to the institutional type of
the providers, government, business or university. Government
investment has been most important for primary production and
processing, business investment for manufacturing and construction
and communications, university investment for the social sciences and
fundamental research, and government for environmental research. This
can be seen in Table 1 which shows data for 1997-98. This data has
not been assembled in this form in more recent years.</p>

<p>Overall, one third of all spending was in the agricultural research
area alone, though the respective providers vary considerably in this
specialisation. The three types of institution have roughly equal
shares of the overall spending in 1997-98.</p>

<p>The main Government providers of R &amp; D are the Crown Research Institutes
(CRIs). These institutes were formed from former government
departments in the early 1990s. The CRIs count as Government
providers and draw on both private sector and public funds. In terms
of total revenue generated (Table 2), the four agriculturally
oriented CRIs have about the same level of R &amp; D expenditure
compared with the five non-agricultural CRIs.  Further, the
agricultural institutes (AgResearch, HortResearch, Crop and Food
Research, Landcare Research) increased revenue at a slower rate than
the non-agricultural institutes (Industrial research, Forest
Research<a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a>,
Environmental Science, and Geological and Nuclear Sciences) - by 49%
in the period 1993-2004 compared with 68% for the non agricultural
institutes.  On this evidence the agricultural sector is only
maintaining its share of R &amp; D funds in the period since the
departmental reforms.</p>

<p>The Chairman of AgResearch, R. Christie, points out in an address to the 2005
Grasslands Conference that agribusiness still constitutes 65 per cent
of the country's merchandise exports, that almost half of exports
come from the agricultural sector, that over the last 20 years the
agricultural sector has been growing at almost twice the rate of the
economy as a whole, and that whereas GDP grew by 39 per cent over the
last 20 years, agricultural GDP grew by 72 per cent. He pleads for
these facts to be taken into account in setting national priorities.
<q>There is more excitement in this country about the economic
potential of a new way to jump off a bridge than there is about a
scientific advance that has the potential to wipe out possums - or
to double the number of lambs we produce in a season</q> Christie,
2005).</p>

<p>Christie therefore envisages a future where pastoral agricultural research
makes a greater claim on the available resources for R &amp; D, and its
export performance and productivity gains are recognised. He sees it
as being in the national interest to promote better R &amp; D in
animals and pastures, to promote innovative science and technology
generally, and to make the best use of limited resources, while at
the same time maintaining environmental sustainability.   
</p>

<h2>Changes in the Organisation of Research </h2>

<p>The structure of public science in New Zealand was reformed in the
early 1990s to move from a corporate state model to a company-based
private model of organisation. At the same time, the public funding
systems were changed from the existing departmental vote allocations
for science work to a bidding system administered by a special agency
– The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST). The
departmental advice units on science were abolished and a new agency
created to coordinate science policy – The Ministry of Research,
Science and Technology (MoRST).</p>

<p>The goal of the reforms was to seek greater efficiencies in the
allocation of public funds to R &amp; D endeavour. There was a
perception among officials that public science tended to <q>crowd
out</q> private endeavour and that departmental organisations were
cumbersome, self-interested and depleted effort. Indeed, in this
period, public choice economics was influential and experimentation
with the institutions of the state was very permissive.  This was
especially true of the science reorganisation (Boston <i>et al</i>
1996). The result of these forces was a movement toward specialist
private delivery organisations funded from a competitive funding
base. After the reforms, MoRST and FRST were to be subject to the New
Public Management model with emphasis on the separation of funder,
purchaser, and provider roles (op cit, p.26).</p>

<p>Prior to 1990, public science administration was dominated by the
Department of Agriculture and the Department of Scientific and
Industrial Research<a class="f" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a>.
These departments operated under the Vote system receiving annual
appropriations from central government. They employed staff, ran
research campuses and determined their own scientific objectives.
There was broad agreement on areas of specialisation though some
duplication did occur. Central oversight was weak although there were
a number of advisory bodies in place in the 1960s and 1970s. The
National Research Advisory Council (NRAC) operated from 1963 to 1986
and proffered advice to central government and was succeeded by the
Science and Technology Advisory Committee until 1992. In addition,
the Department of Agriculture administered an extension service for
farmers and horticulturalists which provided advice on a free basis.
These structures had a number of similarities to the structures in
Australian states and had also borrowed from USA extension models.
Outside the departmental system were a number of industry research
associations for dairy products (DRI), wool research (WRONZ), meat
research (MRINZ), and fertiliser research which were partially funded
by government but owned and controlled by the respective industry
organisations.</p>

<p>Reorganisation of the departments took the form of establishing 10
new research institutes registered as private companies but under
Crown ownership. These were based on subject matter titles eg
Agricultural Research, Crop and Food, Horticulture, Forestry, Water
and Atmospherics, Industrial Research, Land Care Research,
Environmental Science, and Geological and Nuclear Science. An
Institute of Social Science was mooted but later dropped. Each
institute had its own board of directors, appointed by government,
and manages its own assets. Ownership remained with the government,
represented by two shareholding ministers, the Minister for Crown
Research Institutes and the Minister of Finance. </p>

<p>The Departmental appropriations were passed to MoRST and FRST to
administer. As far as FRST is concerned, <q>The Foundation's main
roles are to invest public funds in research and development, provide
independent policy advice on science and technology to government and
encourage technological innovation</q> (NZ Yearbook 1993 p. 291).  The
Public Good Research Fund (PGSF) was established to receive bids from
government departments, Crown funded agencies, research associations,
universities, private companies and individuals, non-profit private
trusts, incorporated societies and state owned enterprises that
conduct public good research. The agencies and organisations competed
to win contracts to undertake agreed research programmes, which
reflect national science priorities (more on these below). The
Foundation was required to work alongside the private sector to
increase their involvement in research and development. The
Technology for Business Growth Programme (TBG), for example, invested
in research and technological development business projects conducted
jointly between business and research institutions. There was also a
Research Associate programme, funded by the Foundation, to encourage
young scientists to further their work in specific areas of priority
research either in a research institution or in industry.</p>

<p>Thus a state model of public research, common to other countries in
the British Commonwealth, was converted to a company-based private
model of organisation in line with the precepts of <i>Public Choice</i>
and the <i>New Public Management</i>. The new organisation split
agriculture research between several crown research institutes and
probably left its particular aims and objectives as unfocussed as
they were before. The extension service was sold to private
enterprise and disappeared off the books. We discuss below the
various attempts to give focus to the needs of different industry
sectors and how the quest for outcomes has probably not improved.</p>

<h2>The New Zealand Science model</h2>

<p>Boston <i>et al</i> (1996) point out that the NZ government reforms
of the 1980s showed a general preference for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>private over public organisations (especially for commercial
	functions);<li>
	<li>non-departmental organisations over ministerial departments
	(especially for policy  implementation rather than advice);</li>
	<li>small scale over large scale organisations;</li>
	<li>single-purpose over multi-purpose organisations;</li>
	<li>pluriform over uniform administrative structures;</li>
	<li>divided over inclusive responsibility (ie the separation of policy
	and operations, the separation of funder, purchaser and provider,
	the separation of operations and regulation, the separation of
	provision and review/audit, the separation of commercial and
	non-commercial, and the separation of responsibilities for
	monitoring the Crown's ownership interests and its purchase
	interests);</li>
	<li>multi-source over single-source supply;</li>
	<li>like with like (primarily on the basis of purpose or the kind of service);</li>
	<li>short hierarchies;</li>
	<li>straight-line accountabilities (ie the avoidance of multiple principals); and</li>
	<li>decentralised administration for the delivery of services.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>They point out that the formal institutional separation of policy 
and operations (and, where relevant, the separation of funder,
purchaser and provider roles) has been implemented to a greater
extent in areas like defence, environmental administration, health
care, housing, justice, and scientific research, than in areas like
labour, police, and social welfare. The strictest application of the
functional model was in the area of scientific research.  In this
area there was a formal split between the roles of funder, purchaser
and provider; the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology was
essentially a single-purpose policy ministry; while the Foundation
for Research Science and Technology was to purchase scientific
research via a competitive bidding process from a series of CRIs,
tertiary institutions and private providers, and monitor the
performance of providers. The monitoring of the Crown's ownership
interest in the CRIs was to be carried out by the Crown Company
Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU). Although the Ministry was the
government's chief advisor on science policy, FRST was also funded
to provide policy advice, thus emerging with multiple advisory,
purchasing, and monitoring roles (Boston et al. p 83). NRAC and the
Advisory Committee disappeared.</p>

<p>In such a reorganisation, there was clearly a loss of institutional
memory in the old government departments and a loss of jobs in that
quarter. Scientists were less discomforted by the administrative
changes as far as job security was concerned but subsequently faced
increased insecurity of tenure as the bidding rounds changed
priorities and moved away from some traditional sacred cows. Job
security was maintained in the extension service by offering
employment in the privatised company though many chose not to take
advantage of it. As far as setting priorities is concerned, a single
agency was an advantage and a single funding agency was in position
to organise a more coherent framework for the selection of projects
and programmes. As will be seen later, defining a science programme
has its own difficulties and the best organisational structure for
this process may not yet have been found. Work on it continues.</p>

<h2>Operating the System</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Research, Science and Technology is the chief
scientific advisor to the government of the day. It does not have an
operational role. The Foundation of Research, Science and Technology
administers the research funds although it also has a small policy
role. MoRST is required to provide a Statement of Intent under its
legislation setting out what the Minister sees as the general
direction of science funding for the forthcoming period. FRST then
administers a bidding round where all the providers submit their
research plans in advance and decisions are reached through a series
of referees and advisory committees. The priorities for upcoming
research are established by MoRST and the government in a general
form but the administrative details fall on FRST.</p>

<p>Thus FRST administers the public good science fund (PGSF) system
which pooled the available government funds for research and
development (R &amp; D) from a number of government departments<a class="f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The newly formed crown research institutes (CRIs), other providers,
and later the universities, were able to draw on these funds provided
they met the administrative criteria for public good research. 

<p>FRST took over a research priority system that had been devised by
the DSIR. The procedure had been developed by defining a research
agenda broken down by what were called <q>output areas</q>. Within
output areas further rules gave guidance to final investment
according to a Science and Technology Expert Panel (STEP) report to
MoRST (MoRST 1992a, p.78). There were 40 output areas originally
although these were later compressed to 19 main categories (see
Appendix 1).</p>

<p>In the final report of the Panel, they raised concerns about the
balance of research funding between research directly impacting on
economic performance, and research underpinning areas on which
economic activity depends indirectly (infrastructure research, and
the social and natural sciences) (MoRST 1992b, p.11). The report
noted that 68 per cent of PGSF funding in 1991-92 was allocated to
the directly <q>wealth creating</q> classes 1 to 19 (of the first list
of output classes) (Appendix 1). They stated that this class of
outputs was already well funded, but output classes 20 to 35 were
more difficult to assess because the benefits they create are less
direct and can be longer term. The report recommended a shift in
emphasis from both the natural sciences and the production groups to
what they called the infrastructural group (output areas 20 to 28).
The implication was that <q>underpinning</q> research is more of a
public good than <q>wealth creating</q> research goods.</p>

<p>The Panel report recommended a productive partnership between the
public and private sector to ensure successful commercialisation of
PGSF research results. It stated that PGSF research is more likely to
be successfully adopted if the research is planned with strong user
involvement and is likely to have the greatest chance of producing
benefits to New Zealand where users have well-established market
linkages and were performing their own research. The implication was
that greater co-operation and co-ordination between sectors would
compensate for the low level of private sector sponsorship of
research (BERL 1995, p.46).</p>

<p>The report recommended that the PGSF should complement successful
private research activities where funds are used to promote strategic
and generic research and where there is a demonstrated need for such
research. Such complementarity should not displace private research
funding, the report states, or support appropriable research.  The
Panel therefore recommended that using the PGSF to complement private
funding <q>should be conditional on a continuation or enhancement of
funding from the private sector</q>. A practical problem was the state
could complement private sector activity without specifying whether
business was a big spender in that output area or not. Re-allocating
investment away from one set of output areas (see Table 1) created
the risk that the gap would not be filled by private enterprise. In
addition, the high so-called private investment in some sectors was
due to the fact that the industry research associations were
arbitrarily classified as <q>business</q> rather than government even
though they were all established with DSIR seed money! The key
challenge was whether public investment could be used to trigger
further private investment in a complementary way, as well as to
create conditions where the up-take of the results of all science
investment was enhanced.</p>
<p>In the MoRST instructions to FRST dated July 1997 these objectives do
not appear to have changed (MoRST 1997a). The Minister noted that the
organisational gains made have resulted in a strong focus on
small-scale purchasing of outputs, over relatively short time frames,
and within a rather rigid framework of rules and procedures. FRST
needed to develop a strategic, far-sighted, and pro-active strategy
for focusing on the achievement of outcomes. <q>It will be crucial to
foster interactive relationships....... in publicly funded
organisations and in the private sector that together underpin a
vibrant and thriving knowledge-based society</q>. With respect to
encouragement of the private sector, <q>funding allocations should be
managed in a way ........that does not diminish the incentives for,
or displace investment by other funders .....</q></p>

<h2>Assessing the Reforms</h2>
<p>In terms of the objectives of
Government Ministers before 1990 to encourage greater private
participation in the R &amp; D market, MoRST statistics show that there
has been a steady increase from around 28 per cent to 36 percent in
the amount of R &amp; D performed in the private sector (Table 3). A
greater share of the research resources is also being channelled
through the universities in the period from 1990-91 to 2003-04.  The
government share has dropped from 44 per cent to 33 per cent over the
same period. It has to be remembered that the CRIs are classified as
Government providers of R &amp; D in this survey while other research
institutes (who are largely funded by industry bodies) are classified
as <q>business</q> by MoRST.</p>

<p>There is a lack of data on the trends in private sponsorship of research in the
agricultural sector along the lines of Table 1. Table 1 does show
that the agricultual/processing sector as a whole was second only to
the environmental sector in being most highly dependent on government
funding and support.  It is therefore pertinent to trace agricultural
research spending through the CRI mechanism to assess the relative
share in the total system given to the agricultural sector by the
public funding authorities and the private sector. It turns out (in
Table 5) that the agricultural share of research resources allocated
by government and derived from the private sector has declined
slightly in the period from 1993-94 to 2004-05 from nearly 55 per
cent to 50 per cent. As our discussion below shows, the agricultural
research community has been aware of these trends and has
increasingly sought to bring their share back to its former levels.
Table 5 also shows a declining share of the public good funding going
to the agricultural institutes which suggests that they are
increasingly seeking private sector funding for all their activities.</p>

<p>Funding patterns are of not the only issue when assessing the
reforms. The quality of the expenditure is critical and this is
difficult to assess in the short run. One indicator of successful R &amp; D
expenditure is the uptake of new technologies but this is difficult
to determine and further complicated by New Zealand’s decision to
abandon significant state funded extension activity. A related issue
is that of the dispersion of scientific knowledge. The CRIs greater
interest intellectual property has led to claims of <q>greater
interest in maximizing it value</q> and claims that <q>in seeking
extract value they have significantly slowed the dispersion and
uptake if knowledge</q>. There is room for further research analyzing
the commercial behaviour of CRIs and their impact on knowledge
production and dispersion.</p>

<h2>Agricultural Angst</h2>

<p>In the early 1990s AgResearch was foremost in complaining that the
competitive bidding process was discriminating against agricultural
research endeavour. In 1997 MoRST instituted an investigation of 
PGSF funding mechanisms and employed reviewers to look at research
fund allocations for 17 of the 19 output area classes then being
employed (<a href="http://www.morst.govt.nz/PGSF/evaluation">www.morst.govt.nz/PGSF/evaluation</a>).

<p>The reports found that research into sheep and beef production
systems and into forage and plant research were being neglected
through the imposition of other priorities on FRST. In turn, the then
funding decisions were starting to cause the breakdown of research
teams built up over the years in some research institutes and the
loss of key personnel. In response to the CRI providers, MoRST had
earlier instituted another form of funding to support CRI staff
capabilities and financial shortfalls – christened ‘non-specific
output funding’ (NSOF) in 1993.  In 1999-00, for example, $26.8m
was allocated to non-specific output funding. This funding was
determined as 10 per cent of the funds allocated the previous year
from the PGSF to each institute. NSOF was for public good science and
technology projects which were not subject to the Government’s
priorities (NZYB 2000, p.346).</p>

<p>Table 4 shows the allocations to the four agricultural <q>output
areas</q> after competitive bidding to the PGSF for the financial
years from 1993-94 to 1999-2000. The table shows that the total PGSF
fund increased by 17.6 per cent between these years and the
agricultural output areas increased by 5.3 per cent in nominal
dollars. As a result, agricultural funding decreased from 46.5 per
cent of total PGSF funding to 41.7 per cent. More marked was the
decline in the allocation to animal industries of -3.0 per cent and
the small increase in forage activities of +0.3 per cent. In real
terms, the reports say, the decline for animal industries was –14.8
per cent and for forage –11.6 per cent to 1997-98.  With rising
wages, these are considerable falls in CRI incomes particularly for
Ag Research.</p>

<p>Although there were 17 output areas reviewed covering most of the
PGSF, only four of the output areas relate to agricultural research.
We present a summary of the main conclusions of the four agricultural
reviews undertaken and then a summary of the overall review.</p>

<p><i>Output area 1: Animal industries:</i> Over the period under review
(to 1997-98), PGSF funding for Output area 1 declined in both nominal
and real terms.  While overall funding for PGSF increased, output
area 1 was static, as new funds were directed to areas perceived to
be of higher priority.  The majority of the reduction appears to have
resulted in a move away from sheep and beef production research. The
main providers are AgResearch, followed by WRONZ, and MIRINZ.  The
report notes the commodity meat trade now has a high value-added
component.  The improvement in the value of these exports is the
result of past research and development effort. The future
development of these exports is dependent on the ability to
consistently produce product to specification, and the increasing
emphasis on food safety and quality. These attributes will increase
the requirement for appropriate research at all stages in the supply
chain including production research. The main commercial funding for
the set of providers comes from the producers boards and could be
considered at risk. The science reforms have encouraged collaboration
between researchers including applications to FRST.  However, the
extensive nature of the industry, and the presence of some commodity
trade biases ‘makes it difficult for researchers to obtain
appropriate direction for research’ (ibid). Farmers as a group were
well aware of the benefits of PGSF funding.</p>

<p><i>Output area 2: Dairy:</i> In the dairy report, it is noted that
funding has grown strongly over the previous 5 years - 69 per cent in
nominal terms and 51 per cent in real terms. The share of the PGSF
fund rose from 3.1 per cent to 4.7 per cent. The report noted that
there was growth in the number of programmes supported and growth in
the size of programmes. Research output was dominated by 3 providers:
AgResearch, DRC and DRI. The providers derive considerable funds from
outside the PGSF system. The over-all level of funding is
considerably less than in output areas 1 and 3 which is surprising
considering the size of the dairy industry. However, many of the
programmes are generic to both animal and dairy outputs and thus
support the dairy industry too. There is a high level of
collaboration between AgRes and DRC. In a survey there was a high
level of awareness of PGSF advantages among end-users. <q>Vertical
integration in the industry ensures research strategies are closely
linked to commercial strategies. The report concludes that output
area 2 is the only agriculturally focused output to attract a
significant increase in funding level over the past five years</q>.</p>

<p><i>Output area 3: Forage:</i> Total funding declined by 1.9 per cent
in nominal terms and 11.6 per cent in real terms to 1997-98. <q>This
decline is a cause for concern</q>. The report notes that forage
production is the base that provides the competitive advantage for
the single largest contributor to the NZ economy – the agricultural
sector. The principal provider is AgResearch. A high level of
collaboration was observed both internationally and within NZ. There
was also a high level of awareness among end-users of the aims of the
PGSF. <q>Industry end-users included in the forage sector are two and
a half times more likely to be involved in the licensing or
commercialisation of products generated by PGSF research compared
with other agricultural sectors</q> (ibid).  Overall output funding
declined from 8.5 per cent of PGSF funding to 7.3 per cent. The
report says: <q>the scientific capacity for forage research is under
threat as the real level of funding has decreased over the five
years</q>.</p>

<p><i>Output area 4: Horticulture:</i> The full title of this report is
<i>Horticulture, Arable and other Food and Beverage Industries. </i>
The report notes that industry funding increased slightly over the 5
year period although there was a decrease immediately after 1993/94.
A number of smaller fruit, crop, ornamentals, vegetables and the
arable groups increased their private funding contributions. 
Government investment has been held at $51m. There was a range of
collaborative networking and subcontracting. The main providers were
HortResearch (56 per cent) and Crop and Food (35 per cent). There was
evidence of <q>strong</q> involvement in PGSF research and also
<q>strong</q> evidence of capacity for accessing international
research.  The report notes that </q>PGSF funding has made a <q>strong</q>
contribution to economic outcomes</q>. The size of individual
programmes appeared to be decreasing.  Total funding increased by 1.3
per cent in nominal terms but decreased by approximately 15 per cent
in real terms. The share of PGSF funding dropped from 19.8 per cent
to 17.6 per cent. <q>Prior to 1995, FRST policy was to direct funds
away from research that was appropriable and this policy affected
this output area. Since 1995, a change in instructions required
greater account to be taken of the relevance of research and
involvement of users. The industry has responded</q> (ibid).</p>

<p>The above reviews of output areas in the agricultural research sector
shows that national priorities moved away from production research
both on the plant and the animal area. FRST was under instruction
from MoRST at all times so that is where primary responsibility lay!
The reasons for the decline in meat and wool production and forage
research investment appear to be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a common belief that agriculture is an <q>old industry</q> and
	support should be going to <q>new</q> industries;</li> 
		<li>the move from production output areas to infrastructure areas (on
	the old list);</li>
	<li>constraints on funding available; 
	</li>
	<li>the movement away from providers of appropriable research; 
	</li>
	<li>a shift away from output areas where PGSF was <q>too dominant</q>: 
	</li>
	<li><q>complementary</q> funding to the private sector;</li>
	<li>the <q>crowding out</q> belief held in some circles; and</li>
	<li>the possible over-application of <q>market failure</q> theory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Change in Direction</h2>
<p>The 1998 review identified increased emphasis on the development of
a technological learning relationship as the primary means of
creating better outcomes from research and the promotion of the
concept of leverage of industry research funding to get better
overall results. There would also need to be an increased emphasis on
environmental outcomes.</p>

<p>The broader findings of the 1998 evaluation  were:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the need for identifying the existence of strategically significant
	knowledge platforms and knowledge outcomes in NZ capable of
	delivering high quality science and technology;</li>
	<li>the identification of the science and technology outputs which have
	significantly contributed to economic performance, environmental
	sustainability, and social cohesion of NZ;</li>
	<li>handling the increasing degree of contestability  among science and
	technology  providers, in the presence of relative stability of
	funding, and constraints on the entrance of new providers in the
	vast majority of PGSF output areas;</li>
	<li>taking advantage of the increased variety of competencies through
	employment of new staff, and the increased level of collaboration
	and sub-contracting among science and technology providers;</li>
	<li>taking advantage of the presence of symmetry of competencies in some
	sub-sectors; in others there was inadequate absorptive capacity
	among users;</li>
	<li>fixing some inconsistency of user support across different output
	areas; and insignificant support from the private sector in funding
	follow-up R &amp; D projects;</li>
	<li>a lack of stronger links with other funding instruments such as
	research funded through Vote: Education and through other votes
	(ibid).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This evaluation was overtaken by a wide consultative initiative known
as the Foresight Project. The Foresight Project was a consultative
process which attempted to document a vision of a desirable future
and the strategies needed to get there (MoRST website: Statement by
Minister Williamson). The new framework for establishing R &amp; D
priorities was designed to ensure that Government's investment
would be managed in a more enabling and less prescriptive way. The
new investment framework was based <q>science envelope goals</q> and
<q>target outcomes</q>. In summary, the science envelope goals
identified were:</p>
<ul>
	<li>An Innovation goal – accelerate knowledge creation and human
	capital;</li>
	<li>An Economic goal – creation of value in new and improved products;</li>
	<li>An Environmental goal – knowledge that sustains a healthy
	environment;</li>
	<li>A Social goal – knowledge of the physical determinants of
	wellbeing.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>The science envelope goals were to provide overall direction for the
public investment in Research, Science and Technology. They were designed to encourage
stakeholders and purchase agents to seek more effective delivery of
outcomes. The target outcomes are 14 future desired states envisaged
by the Foresight Project that are cross-sectoral and which provide a
strategic context for the development of Research, Science and Technology portfolios. The
existing purchase agents (FRST, HRC, Royal Society) would continue to
purchase research outputs in such a way that they are structured and
grouped so that they make a coherent contribution to the science
envelope goals. <q>Negotiations and relationship building are
critical to a stable long-term purchasing environment, but
contestability and fostering a diversity of ideas and approaches will
remain important aspects of the purchasing strategy</q> (ibid,p.14).
FRST with its responsibility for investments under several <q>output
classes</q> will be expected to organise contracts with providers
under each of these out put classes  to create portfolios of Research, Science and Technology
contracts that make contributions towards target outcomes.</p>

<p>This seems to be an exercise of organisational rearrangement rather
than one of fundamental change in priorities. FRST did not have to
respond greatly to the Foresight Project and the consequent
reorganisation of the goals and output areas. The Treasury outputs
remained the same and the votes for outputs thus defined did not vary
much from year to year. Despite the initial stability, MoRST have,
since 1999, been feeling their way toward more devolution in decision
making. The latest manifestation is the <i>Picking up the Pace</i>
document. The portfolio approach stays the same but larger projects
and longer terms of contract are to be considered by FRST in
allocating research funds. FRST have delayed the beginning of the
2006 round of bidding while new directions for providers are worked
out.</p>

<p>These paragraphs describe the overall framework for funding R &amp; D
in New Zealand in this period and where it now stands. To understand
where agricultural research (AR) fits in as only part of the total
investment we have to look for indirect evidence of trends in funding
from the state and the private sectors and in income derived by
providers for various purposes. Before 1999 we have data on the
allocations of public research funds for the various output areas as
they were then called, and since 1999 we have some idea of the
spending of CRIs on specific subject areas and the sources of their
income.</p>

<h2>Developments in the Crown Research Institutes</h2>

<p>The output area format was abandoned in 1999-2000 and the envelope
goals were adopted for layouts, priorities and statistical layouts.
Emphasis moved to the research funds or portfolios administered by
FRST, and how their benefits could be maximised. This makes tracking
agricultural research more difficult for us. As a replacement we
explore for the 1994-2005 period the rise and fall in CRI incomes
(Table 5).</p>

</p>
<p>In the first part of the period 1993-94 to 1997-98, just discussed,
agricultural research  institute total income was a slowly declining 
proportion of all CRI income; agricultural institute drawdown on PGSF
funds  also fell slowly; and agricultural drawdown of PGSF funds as
proportion of all income declined from 36.9 per cent in 1993-94 to
32.5 per cent in 1997-98. In Table 3 the MoRST data showed this
percentage declining from 46.5 per cent to 42.2 per cent. The two
sources are not exactly comparable as output areas do not coincide
with institute boundaries.</p>

<p>In the second period, for which we lack data on output areas, the
proportion of total income is  fairly constant; there is a continuing
trend of the share of PGSF money starting to decline, and the share
of PGSF income in total CRI income falls more quickly than earlier.
Thus we see the trends shown in the earlier period are continued in
the later period and are starting to accelerate. There has been some
reaction to these trends by the R &amp; D providers which we discuss in
Section 3.2.</p>

<p>In July 2005 these concerns were picked up by a working group
sponsored by Dairy Insight, Dexcel and Fonterra in a document <q>Dairy
Industry Capability Needs Review</q>. The review noted that there was
still no coordinated framework for research in the pasture and feed
supply area, that there were still significant capability gaps in
animal research, that there was a lack of strategic level leadership
and coordination  which would be proactive in identifying
infrastructure and compliance options, and that there was no entity
with the mandate and necessary resources to guide, promote, and
evaluate human resource development at the farmer level, extension
staff and research organisation levels). Key gaps were identified in
the R &amp; D, extension and education structure, in the information
available for performance analysis, investment and costs, and in
on-farm industry strategic leadership and planning. Indeed the review
recommends the formation of a strategic planning unit along the lines
of the Meat and Wool Economic Service.</p>

<h2>Current Issues in Agricultural Research</h2>

<h6>Setting of Government priorities</h6> 

<p>In 2004-05, discussions between the Government and the research
industry led to a new approach to allocating research funds to
science providers. The aim appears to be to get away from short term
contestable funding in the public choice model and move toward long
term commitment of resources to individual providers to plan their
own priorities. This could be interpreted as a return to the priority
setting process under the DSIR and MAF where priorities were
internalised within departments with the surety that the Minister of
Finance would always provide the committed funds in following years.
Duplication was not then seen as a problem. While Government has made
several announcements in the course of 2005 setting out an outline of
the new system of funding, the agricultural research community in
particular has been increasingly vocal on the role it wishes to play
and critical of the old contestable fund system. International
interest may well lie in these developments given the past publicity
for the so-called <q>New Zealand Science Model</q>.</p>

<p>Before the Budget in May, there was newspaper discussion of the
replacement of non-specific output funding (NSOF) by a capability
fund (Dominion Post 11/05/05). The article noted that NSOF had been
paid out to help meet operating costs, pay for non-funded research
and retain staff.  CRIs had complained that 2004-05 funding of NSOF
of $32.376m was inadequate to retain promising scientists, but
funding agencies were concerned that providing money without
specifying how it should be used made accountability difficult.  A
scientist was quoted as saying <q>the key issue is uncertainty. Once
you put in a funding application you don’t know for nine months
whether or not you are going to be successful. That makes it
difficult to plan ahead</q>. The Budget itself was devoid of details
of the NSOF problem, but did include $17.8m in new capability funding
for CRIs in addition to some other funding increases.</p>

 <p>Minister Maharey then made a major announcement at the beginning of
July. He said that it is now time for less contestability and more
annual <q>devolved allocations</q> to CRIs. The methods of allocation
were still being developed. He noted that research institutes need
sustainable funding  to be able to maintain core competencies,
finance capital works, new equipment and address the loss of
researchers  and inability to recruit young scientists.
<q>Contestability is not completely the wrong answer, because it
drives innovation, but it went to extremes</q>. He further noted that
previously the aim of science policy under successive governments had
been to reduce funding of research of benefit to industry from the
public purse, requiring industries and producers  to contribute
directly to appropriate Crown research institute research programmes.
He also indicated it was time CRI boards were given more of the
discretionary roles they were set up for, instead of the funding
bodies making all the key decisions.</p>

<p>In the 2005 statement of intent,  <i>Sustaining Strong Investment:
Excellence in Knowledge and Innovation</i>, the Minister (Mr Maharey)
announced that the government would continue to sustain strong
investment in Research Science and Technology, particularly on people and resources. The new
Capability Fund will <i>replace</i> the former Non-Science Outputs
Fund (NSOF), to assist the CRIs to maintain core capabilities. Extra
funding will be provided for the Marsden Fund, Fulbright Awards,
Health research, a scheme called Envirolink to encourage regional
councils to access CRIs, research consortia, Technology New Zealand
and an Investment Opportunities Fund (to encourage a more rapid
response to international opportunities and also to fund relocation
of exceptional scientists to New Zealand).</p>

<p>In the <i>Picking up the Pace</i>, government confirmed that it had
moved away from the competitive bidding model for R &amp; D funding
toward more long term arrangements with the science providers. They
needed to step up from simplistic public choice theory  models of the
1990s.  The needs of the industry were: long-term sustainable
investment;  a stable funding environment; support for high
performers; a clear and purposeful R &amp; D agenda; enhanced
opportunities for collaboration, networking and technology transfer;
and Research Science and Technology that is valued, trusted and supported by New Zealanders.
One of the early indications of the approach is FRST’s Outcome
Based Investments (OBIs) which are focused on research sectors where
the contracted research delivers benefits that are widely dispersed
and not solely of value to a single individual or organization.</p>

<p>The intention is investment will keep pace with increasing research
costs, innovative opportunities and OECD trends, accompanied by
matching growth in the private sector. They proposed: development of
a multi-year Research Science and Technology budget package;  accelerated growth of R &amp; D
investment  by private companies through leveraging  public sector
investment and applying other incentives; greater trust in research
organisations to make decisions  where they have an information
advantage and can maximise the advantage of a devolved investment
approach;  devolve up to 60 per cent of PGSF  to research
organisations;  ensure non devoted funds (Health, NERF, Marsden and
Technology NZ) provide regular opportunities for new ideas to be
funded; to define what a successful CRI looks like; and
to develop measures for financial and non-financial performance.</p>

<p>The aim is to provide a clear understanding of critical
responsibilities of players in an Research Science and Technology system with a focus on
core capabilities that deliver benefit to New Zealand so research
organisations can mange better  for their people and future research
priorities. Alongside the multi-year budget package  a one off
statement will be developed on the obligations and expectations for
sectors. A series of Research Science and Technology directions or roadmaps for key science
areas would be developed with relevant groups of stakeholders, key
users and research organisations. There would be increased emphasis
on collaboration and networking (MoRST 2005).</p>

<p>This setting of the scene is reflected in FRST's recent statement
of intent dated April 2005 (FRST 2005a). <q>To support the
Government’s strategies and address the Minister’s challenges
FRST’s strategy focuses on:</q></p>
<ul>
	<li>investing in areas that will help achieve measurable target outcomes
	where Research Science and Technology can make a real difference in improving wealth and
	wellbeing;</li>
	<li>investing in a manner that encourages improved performance in
	achieving these outcomes including greater devolution  of decision
	making to Research Science and Technology providers;</li>
	<li>evaluating and bench marking performance to support making the right
	investment choices to reinforce and reward good performance; 
	</li>
	<li>enhancing the Foundation’s role as facilitator of an integrated
	and responsive innovation system.</li>
</ul>

<p>FRST tell us that the Foundation is currently assisting MoRST as they
work through the policy development  process.  <q>Over the last
couple of years we have been trying various ways to provide longer
and larger investments while still ensuring that emerging research
and researchers are able to succeed with proposals for investment. We
have been working to identify practical implementation issues,
identification of which is essential to achieve the improvements we
are all looking for</q> (N. Allison, FRST, pers com, October 2005).</p>

<p>In a document about investment signals and requests for proposals on
the website (FRST 2005b), the Foundation outlines how it will handle
investment proposals for the round starting in July 2007. FRST notes
that the Minister wishes to bring greater stability into the funding
environment. This will involve reducing contestability in the system
by devolving funding and detailed decision making to research
organisations although some portfolios funds will be released for
investment through fully contestable project rounds. FRST has
received consistent feedback and support on the need for New Zealand
to use its limited Research Science and Technology investment in a more focused manner where
that is possible.  FRST interprets this as investment that is
narrower and deeper. Actions they propose to take include: reducing
compliance costs through shorter concept documents; increased focus
on science merit and track record through fewer proposal assessment
criteria; stronger investment focus through target outcomes, themes
and priority research questions;  development of scientific road
maps; increased focus on researcher performance and capability;
restructuring of research portfolios and managers; a new condensed
portfolio structure and cross portfolio alignment.</p>

<h3>Recent responses from the agricultural research community</h3>

<p>In the meantime, the agricultural research interests were not sitting
quietly. There have been initiatives by Lincoln and Massey
Universities to enhance the synergies between their research
programmes. Likewise other collaborative agreements have been formed
and new initiatives have been established such as the Waikato
Innovation Park with strong links between Universities, CRIs and the
agricultural sector. Significantly AgResearch has returned to
highlighting its identity as an ‘Agricultural Research’ institute
rather than a <q>Life Sciences</q> institute.</p>

<p>One key development has been the development of a <q>Strategic Framework for
Dairy Farming's Future</q>. The purpose of the framework is to <q>set
the strategic direction for all on-farm research, development,
extension and education</q> Funding to achieve the targets and
objectives <q>will come from a number of sources: government,
industry good, Agmardt, provider investment, industry and
agribusiness</q>.  The major dairy cooperative, Fonterra, was the
driver behind this initiative as part of its quest to achieve
industry growth and productivity goals. Hence it needed to have a
plan for increased efficiency that did not compromise economic,
environmental and animal welfare imperatives.</p>

<p>The first version of the strategy document was adopted jointly by the Boards of
Dairy Insight (the dairy industry levy collecting body) and Dexcel
(the major provider of on farm dairy research and extensions) in 2004
and then endorsed by the wider industry. A second version,
commissioned by Dairy 21 (a peak industry body with membership from
Fonterra, Livestock Improvement, Dairy Companies Association, Dexcel
and AgResearch) has been drafted after feedback and consultation.  </p>

<p>The industry has set a goal of boosting farm productivity by 4 per
cent per year. Dairy 21 has already lobbied Government for a $60m
boost to pastoral farming research. The Chairman of Fonterra states
that putting resources into <q>core</q> agriculture is a safer bet
than some less-established sectors, and that the above sum is a
relatively small amount of money given the potential economic
benefits to the country (The Dominion Post, 28.9.05). This strategy
will not have been helped by Fonterra's choice to base a major
research centre in Melbourne rather than in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Fonterra was clearly showing considerable leadership in getting the
pastoral research participants together. According to the National
Business Review (16.12.05), Fonterra has been pushing its own
research agenda vigorously since cutting its $159m funding package to
biotec subsidiary ViaLactia, in a major restructure in 2004. The CEO
stated that the company wanted a more efficient model that makes
sense for all parties involved. It wanted to avoid as much
duplication in the farming sector as possible and to ensure the
company was not burdened with spending money on research that does
not directly benefit its value-added goals. Fonterra is said to have
initiated the Dairy 21 project.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, AgResearch was in the news on the 1<sup>st</sup>
of November 2005. The CEO announced that AgResearch needed $73 m for
buildings alone. Dr West argued that the extra $60m should go
straight to the Crown research institutes who will then decide what
to spend it on. He also argued that farmers' contributions to
research investment should rise too. <q>The $10m they contribute in
levies is not much when you consider farm gate returns are $6
billion</q>.  AgResearch's strategic plan for the next 15 years was
based on the country investing in its core strengths, the husbandry
of plants and animals, he said. He outlined that major investments
were required in an animal health laboratory in Palmerston North, a
new animal animal handling facility at Grasslands, a biosecurity and
infectious diseases facility near Wellington, a centre for
reproduction and genomics in Dunedin and other new buildings.  Dr
West said it was an article of faith that more funding would come.</p>

<p>Taken with Government showing a willingness to increase devolved
funding to the CRIs [though the increase in the 2005-06 Budget is
quite small] there is a marked willingness in the agricultural
research sector to expand their research activities. However there
does appear to be some confusion between research project investment
and capital spending. More importantly, the agricultural research
lobby has increased its mass and firepower and has started to put
significant research programs in front of government for public good
spending. Private participation will be needed as well. It appears
unlikely Government will come to the party in a big way given other
pressures on government expenditure. While the Minister talks of
investing 3 per cent of GDP (a trebling) in future years, marked
increases in research spending by the government or the private
sector are not that likely. What the Dairy 21 group might achieve is
winning a greater share of the public funds in which case it will be
at the expense of some other group. This then comes back to who sets
the priorities for R &amp; D spending and how national priorities are
determined.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Research Priorities for Agricultural Research</h2>

<p>The last 15 years in New Zealand has seen a significant experiment
undertaken with regard to the organisation of R &amp; D
services. In this country there has traditionally been a fairly even
split of resources between the government sector, the private sector
and the universities. Before the 1990 reforms, some commentators were
of the view that the government sector was too dominant and had been
creating a <q>crowding-out</q> effect on the private sector. The
erstwhile aim of the reforms was to increase private participation
and to decrease the influence of the large government departments and
the funding drain on the government. To this end, 10 research
companies were set up to absorb the science roles of all government
departments.  To finance the new structures, the former government
votes were placed in a government pool – known as the Public Good
Science Fund (PGSF) – for allocation to all research providers on a
bidding process.</p>

<p>The agricultural sector was previously serviced by the Department of
Agriculture with some support in basic science from the Department of
Science Industry and Research. Large research campuses were created
over the years for crops, animals and horticulture and the Department
of Agriculture provided a free extension service.  At least one third
of the total resources available were devoted to the agricultural
sector. The agricultural sector in common with the environmental
sector were the most highly supported by central government compared
with other sectors. </p>

<p>Since the reforms began the allocation of resources to science has
kept pace with gross domestic product.  In terms of provider spending
there has been an increase in the share of research being performed
by the private sector and the universities and a decline in the share
conducted by government agencies. In terms of overall funding, there
has been a parallel increase from the private sector and a decline in
the government share. These changes were predicated by the reforms in
the first place and could be said to have achieved what the planners
set out to do.</p>

<p>Agricultural research before the reforms absorbed about one third of
all resources made available. Going by the spending by the
agricultural crown institutes (Ag Research, Crop &amp; Food Research,
HortResearch and Landcare research.) the share of CRI resources going
to agricultural research has almost been maintained (55 per cent in
1993-94 and 52 per cent in 2004-05). At the same time the share of
agricultural research funded by the government has fallen from 59 per
cent to 50 per cent.   Thus the agricultural sector has followed the
overall trend in decreased government participation and increased
private sector participation.</p>

<p>In a mid-term review by MoRST in 1998 these trends were already evident.
Data on the then <q>output areas</q> showed that there was a serious
decline in resources being devoted to forage research and to animal
research.  The mid-term review showed that the dairy industry had
maintained and even improved its share of resources while the small
crops sector had maintained its share.</p>

<p>There was criticism of the funding mechanism and the rules which were
used to choose successful projects. These protests probably served to
prevent the decline in resources going to the agricultural sector
from going any further.</p>

<p>Concurrently with the above review, MoRST was seeking a new mandate
for future planning of research in what is known as the Foresight
Project. In the light of wide consultation with interested parties a
new set of achievable outcomes was adopted by the government which
did away with the output area approach. We maintain that the priority
setting for individual projects did not change much under the new set
of outcomes and we noted that Budget allocations continued largely
under the old expenditure classes.</p>

<p>In 2005, the government issued the outlines of a new system of public
good research funding which would be based on longer-term contracts
with the research providers and devolving more of the individual
project choice to them also. At the time of writing FRST had not
published a new set of guidelines for research applicants which would
indicate how the rules would then apply to the various providers. We
observe that, in a curious sort of way, this development is a return
to the ways of the 1970s and 1980s when the two large departments
were in sole charge of spending priorities for the public good
science money. Allocations of research funds are still politically
contentious and there is ongoing debate concerning appropriate
decision-making by central Government vis a vis research providers
and industry participants. High transaction costs continue to be a
burden and politicians and interest groups continue to aspire to a
dynamic research system which they can influence.</p>

<p>This review is completed by noting resurgence in the private sector
research interests in agriculture in 2005. The major participants
like Ag Research, Fonterra, Dexcel and Dairy Insight have produced a
series of reports on future developments, particularly for the dairy
sector, which envisage both increased private spending and an
increased contribution from the government. It should be noted that
the clamour is not so strong on the meat and wool side, though the
above protagonists see all the animal and forage industries working
together for the common good and with an increased commitment from
public funds.</p>
