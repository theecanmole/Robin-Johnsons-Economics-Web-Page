<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>In recent years a number of new agricultural economics papers have emerged
that focus on the <i>implementation</i> of policy rather than on policy 
<i>formation</i>.  The papers use a comparative institutional approach to the delivery of agricultural
policy in different countries and appear to have originated in the
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations
(Sandiford and Rossmiller 1996). Case studies and commentaries have
appeared in various FAO publications and seminars, and most
recently a symposium on the subject was presented at the 1998
conference of the Agricultural Economics Society at Reading
University, England ( Johnson 1996, Williams 1997, Haebig <i>et al</i> 1998).</p>

<p>The emphasis in this series of papers is on the
implementation of policy proposals as enacted in the legislature
and asks whether the intention of the legislators is being met in
the delivery process and whether such processes meet wider economic
criteria such as the meeting of set targets (effectiveness),
avoiding unwanted effects (equity and income distribution
considerations), and delivering at least cost (efficiency). The
originating authors suggest using a structure/conduct/performance
approach to individual policy programmes to bring out the contrast
between the original intentions and actual management of the
programme. Structure is used to identify what was originally set
out in any legislation including design of policy instruments;
conduct is used to identify how the legislative programme was
interpreted and managed in practice; and performance is used to
assess how well the policy system met the original objectives of
the programme in terms of delivering the scheduled benefits to the
targeted recipients. The authors suggest that this latter task will
be made easier by examining four criteria of performance:
effectiveness, efficiency, enforceability and equity (Sandiford and
Rossmiller 1996, pp. 7-12).</p>

<p>The review of policy
programmes within government is an ongoing process. Both political
and bureaucratic players are concerned with the impacts of their
programmes for both selfish and national interest reasons. Such
reviews may not be made public but could be assumed to include many
of the features of the FAO proposals.<sup><a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" id=
"sdfootnote3anc">3</a></sup> Sandiford and
Rossmiller draw on advisory work experience on policy development
in developing countries where there appears to be a large gap
between intention and execution especially from the donor's
viewpoint.</p>

<p>This initiative can be seen
as one of learning from domestic and international experience and
making better policy as a result. The authors state that they are
trying to develop a framework for structured thinking about policy
implementation that will assist them to do their policy work better
(ibid., p.1)<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym" id=
"sdfootnote4anc">4</a></sup>. The wider
implication is that others can learn from the experience as well
and that more specific frameworks of evaluation and examples can be
produced that would help not only advisors in the international
organisations but many practitioners within policy shops in both
developed and less developed
countries.</p>


<h2><u>Previous policy delivery approaches</u></h2>
 
<p>Implementing public policy is the job of the
bureaucrats or other agencies appointed for the purpose. There is a
vast literature on how bureaucracy works. But the more specific
analytical structures that concern policy delivery systems (PDSs)
are those explaining conflicts between the interests of the
politicians and the bureaucrats, and between them and the interest
groups or constituents as Horn (1995) calls them. In the public
choice literature, this is called the "political market" (Johnson
D. B. 1991), where differences in views and interests are resolved
by some form of mutual bargaining and agreement.</p>

<p><b>Public choice economics</b> focuses on the respective roles of the
legislators, administrators and constituents. It is the roles and
motivation of these three main actors that are important. Decisions
are assumed to be made by individuals who act as if largely
self-interested and rational in the pursuit of this interest (Horn
1995, p.7). Completed legislative programmes, which create the
PDSs, are seen as the result of negotiation between the actors as
they pursue their different interests. These decisions determine
the structure of each policy proposal and the way it will be
administered. Such structures and administrative systems may or may
not influence how they will be executed in practice (the conduct
paradigm).</p>
<p>
 

<p><b>The transaction cost approach</b> to public administration focuses
more on the design of legislation (Horn 1995). Legislators and
their constituencies are seen as engaged in a form of exchange.
Legislators want electoral support and constituents want the
private benefits - or to reduce the private costs - of legislation.
The amount of net electoral support legislators receive from
promoting a piece of legislation depends on the flow of benefits
and costs that private interests expect it to generate over time.
The implementation features of the legislation bear on this
calculus because private interests are sufficiently forward looking
to anticipate how <i>decisions on implementation</i>
  will affect the flow of benefits
and costs. That is why there are often heated disputes over
decisions on matters like the scope of delegated authority, the
form of organisation charged with implementation, and the
procedures administrative agents must adopt. These factors affect
"who" ultimately "gets what" out of the legislation. Because the
long term impact of legislation is capitalised into its present
"value" to supporters and opponents alike, the enacting coalition
must be concerned about this long term impact, even if it has a
short political life (Horn 1995, p.13). The design of legislation
may thus reflect the interests of the different groups taking part
in the political process and this may well have little regard for
equity and efficiency considerations and other components of the
national interest.</p>

<p>A distributional view of the impact of economic legislation is given
by <b>political preference functions</b> or economic models of the political
decision-making process. These models attempt to measure the
benefits to producers and consumers and costs to taxpayers of given
legislative programmes in terms of producer and consumer surpluses
generated against some base period or situation (Swinnen and van
der Zee 1993). The so-called "weights" derived in the analysis
measure for each group the percentage change in welfare brought
about by the government intervention from the base case. Most
agricultural support measures, for example, favour producers at the
expense of taxpayers or consumers. This is a "distribution"
approach to implementation of policy, and, where dead-weight losses
are measured, provides some measure of fiscal
efficiency.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the changes in welfare of different groups
may not be explicit at the time of the legislative enactment. This
would depend on the complexity of the proposed programme, back-up
support for the legislature from the bureaucracy, and the degree of
compromise implicit in a legislative measure from interest group
pressure. One prominent Australian economist believes that the
effects on social welfare (including other sectors than
agriculture) of the policy of protecting Australian manufacturing
industry were so complex that the huge economic losses generated by
these policies could scarcely have been <i>planned</i>  (Martin 1989, p.3).
This reasoning also casts doubt on Horn's hypothesis that the long
term implications of legislation are <i>fully</i>  appreciated by the
interest groups when they seek modifications in the enactment
phase.</p>
<p>Political scientists see economic decision making in Government as an
<b>incremental process</b> where legislators and bureaucrats learn by
experience and re-jig previous legislation or introduce fresh
legislation which encompasses several previous enactments (
Braybrooke and Lindblom 1963, Blaug 1992). Newly-elected
politicians start with on-going activities and gradually begin to
define objectives in the light of experience with policies. They do
not have a well-defined political preference function that economic
observers can identify and specify, but move from crisis to crisis
defining their objectives as they proceed. These reasons make it
difficult to specify the 
 <i>ex ante</i>  distribution implications of a given measure,
though after a period of time the <i>ex post</i>   implications can and have been
studied in the literature (Swinnen and van der Zee <i>op cit</i>) if only at a very
aggregate level.</p>

<p>The above review therefore suggests that better policy could result from
greater public study of policy programmes in an  <i>ex
post</i>   framework. The question
of  <i>ex ante</i>  analytical constructs is still a requirement
for policy advisors within departments, but if lessons are to be
learned from previous experience, then an  <i>ex post</i>
  framework is required that is reasonably universal and which can be adapted to the job in hand by
international advisors and by in-house advisors in the various
economic ministries around the world. Where Governments already
have procedures in place, it is important to ask the right
questions in such evaluations.</p>

<p>This paper concentrates on the institutional aspects
of public policy. By institutional arrangements is meant the
political institutions that operate in a country, including the
structure of the parliamentary system, the role of the bureaucracy,
and any conventions regarding operational rules within the
government system and commerce. The paper employs the transaction
cost model of public administration to specify the issues likely to
be encountered. It asks how do specific policy proposals come into
being, and what forces shape them? What continuity can be expected
from the proposals and what built-in provisions are available to
carry this out. What are the appropriate instruments for executing
a given policy, and what are the appropriate bodies for
administering them? The paper recognises that governmental
institutions vary from country to country depending on the origins
of their constitutional and legal frameworks. It finds that there
is considerable universality across countries in the formation and
administration of economic policy. Two case studies of policy
evaluation are discussed. </p>

<h2><u>Transaction cost models</u></h2>
<p>These models focus on how governments are and should
be organised. They deploy the rationality hypothesis and a theory
of transaction costs to explain how government organisations work.
They posit that effective public administration requires that
transaction costs be minimised in determining and pursuing
society's goals (Zeckhauser 1995). Legislators are regarded as
self-seeking in their use of legislation to increase their net
political support (Horn 1995, p.13). Their opportunities are
limited by a number of &lsquo;transaction costs&rsquo;. These are the time and
effort it takes to reach agreement on legislative refinements and
any time and effort that affected private interests have to
subsequently devote to participating in implementation and
administration; political uncertainty that the legislation will
last; uncertainty that the legislation will be administered as
intended; and, uncertainty about the distribution of private
benefits and costs. </p>

<p>The legislators who are most likely to remain in power are those who
are most successful in overcoming these transaction problems, such
as those who are best able to reassure their supporters that the
benefits of legislation will not be lost to administrators in the
implementation, or undone by subsequent legislatures (Horn 1995,
p.14). In this context, Horn draws on agency theory in his
discussion of  <i>implementation</i>  of legislation. As he sees
it:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp; the enacting coalition and its constituents must
rely on administrative agents to implement their arrangements - it
must delegate to get things done; </p>
<p>ii.&nbsp; these agents do not necessarily share the
objectives of the enacting coalition and its constituents;
and </p>
<p>iii. it is very difficult to monitor these agents and create a system
of  <i>ex post</i> rewards and sanctions that will ensure that they act to protect the
interests represented at enactment.</p>

<p>These problems create agency costs - that is the costs incurred to induce
administrators to implement faithfully what was intended in the
legislature, and the losses legislators and constituents sustain by
being unable to do so perfectly. They include the costs associated
with selecting administrators and monitoring their compliance, the
costs of using  <i>ex post</i> corrective devices [rewards, sanctions, and
legislative direction], and the cost of any residual non-compliance
that produces  <i>a difference between the
policy</i><i>enacted and what is implemented</i> 
 (ibid, p.19). There are a number of
administrative mechanisms that legislators can draw on that
minimise these costs: contracting out versus in-house delivery,
tax-funded bureaux [departments], non-profit tax-financed
regulatory agencies [as in the US], and revenue-earning state-owned
enterprises [as in the British system]. Each has its advantages and
disadvantages (ibid, pp.9, 40,
170).</p>

<p>Private interests have a definite interest in  <i>implementation</i>
  (ibid, p.13).</p>

<p>Legislators and their constituencies [Horn's
term for private interests] are seen as engaged in a form of
exchange. Legislators want electoral support and constituents want
private benefits - or reduced private costs - of legislation. The
amount of net electoral support legislators receive from promoting
a piece of legislation depends on the flow of benefits and costs
that private interests expect it to generate over time. The
implementation features of the legislation bear on this calculus
because private interests are sufficiently forward looking to
anticipate how  <i>decisions on
implementation</i>  will affect the
flow of benefits and costs. That is why there are often heated
disputes over decisions on matters like the scope of delegated
authority, the form of organisation charged with implementation,
and the  <i>procedures</i> 
 administrative agents must adopt. These
factors affect &ldquo;who&rdquo; ultimately &ldquo;gets what&rdquo; out of the
legislation.</p>

<p>Thus the design of legislation reflects the
interests of the different groups taking part in the political
process and this may well have little regard for equity and
efficiency considerations. Most important is what Horn calls the
&lsquo;commitment&rsquo; problem. The flow of benefits to legislators is often
much more immediate than the flow of benefits to constituents
(ibid, p.16). Constituents run the risk that the present or
subsequent legislative coalitions might undermine the benefits of
given legislation. This is a problem for legislators because
forward-looking constituents will assess the durability of future
legislative benefits and costs and reflect that assessment in the
degree of electoral support they are willing to offer. Thus
legislators cannot guarantee constituents 
<i>durable</i>  benefits but they
can make binding arrangements that might tie down future
legislators<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" id=
"sdfootnote5anc">5</a></sup>.
Constituents respond by seeking guarantees that these bindings will
be entered into at the design stage, if, and when, they are
consulted.</p>

 <h2><u>Choice of administrative instruments</u></h2> 

<p>The transaction cost model suggests, other things
being equal, that the national interest would be best served by
governments choosing the most efficient instruments available to
accomplish any given policy objective (Trebilcock 1995, p.25). The
argument is that, whatever the policy objective, it ought to be
achieved at the lowest social cost: nobody gains by needlessly
dissipating resources. A set of political axioms governing policy
and instrument choice behaviour includes: </p>

<p>i.&nbsp;&nbsp; choosing policies that confine the benefits to
marginal voters [those whose votes count] and confining the costs
to infra-marginal voters [those who are strongly committed to the
governing party];</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp; choosing policies that provide benefits in
concentrated form and impose costs in dispersed forms; </p>
<p>iii. choosing policies that will secure the
co-operation of the bureaucracy; </p>
<p>iv.&nbsp; choosing policy instruments that minimise real
costs over time when they fall on a small group; and </p>
<p>v.&nbsp;&nbsp; choosing policy instruments that bring benefits
within the current electoral cycle. </p>

<p>It is said that these axioms &lsquo;explain&rsquo; the widely expressed perception of a
mis-match between policy instruments and <i>ideal</i>  policy objectives
(Trebilcock, <i>op cit</i>). Such mis-matching is unlikely to be the
random product of mistakes, ignorance or stupidity on the part of
collective decision makers, but in many cases is likely to reflect
systematic incentive structures that the community has built into
political institutions such as one man-one vote and regular cycles
of elections!(ibid, p.27).</p>

 
 <h2><u>Evaluation of policy structures and instruments</u></h2>
 <p> Evaluation needs to focus on the transaction cost
implementation model with respect to: </p>
<p>a. aims of the enacting legislation (structure),</p>
<p>b. consultation at the enactment phase of the legislation (design), </p>
<p>c. choice of instruments (efficiency), </p>
<p>d. behaviour of the delivery agents (conduct), and </p>
<p>e. performance in terms of the original aims.</p>

 
 
<p>Two case studies in the recent literature
demonstrate fairly close application of the principles discussed so
far. They are a study of the EU milk support policy (Williams
1997), and a study of the deregulation of the New Zealand wheat
industry (Nixon 1993). </p>

<p>With regard to the  <b>aims</b> of EU milk policy, Williams (1997, p.107)
states :    </p>
<p class="blocktext">The performance criteria are here being used <u>endogenously</u>: the
focus of attention is a judgement of how effective and efficient
the policy and its delivery system is in fulfilling its 
<i>stated aims</i>. Many discussions of the CAP [especially those emanating from the UK]
usually implicitly adopt a marginalist approach in which judgement
is passed on the system in relation to what the writer 
<i>believes</i>  would be the outcome of a free-market situation. Such discussions frequently
dismiss  <i>the aims</i>  of the policy without discussion and never consider the policy
delivery system. Nethertheless, the policy exists to fulfil the
requirements of Article 39 of the Treaty, which remains in the
original form and as such is part of &ldquo;the economic constitution&rdquo; of
the 15 member states. Moreover, the narrower aims of the policy
legislation, particularly as stated in the articles of 804/68,
remain the law of the EU. The EU has an agreement with the
contracting parties of the GATT: this may require fundamental
modifications to the milk policy but not to the Treaty, as Article
39 is not currently on the agenda of the Inter-Governmental
Conference for the revision of the Maastricht Treaty. Therefore the
analysis of milk policy... considers the policy in relation to its
aims and does not question the aims themselves. (italics in
original)</p>

<p>
 
    
 <b>Consultation at enactment
stage</b>  : The milk policy is
determined by the European Commission in Brussels; the interests of
the different original members of the Union had to be taken into
account in drafting Article 39. The producer interests are very
powerful in France and Germany in particular, and the enactment
owes a lot to them though Williams does not specifically say so in
his study, but states (ibid p.20 ):    </p>

<p>Around the central process of Community decision
making through its principal constitutions there is considerable
opportunity, particularly in agriculture and the dairy sector, for
the activities of pressure groups and "industry experts" [usually
the representatives and employees of powerful organisations in the
industry]. Farmers' unions are represented in Brussels through the
activities of COPA [Committee of Agricultural Producer's
organisations in the EC] and co-operative marketing organisations
are represented through COGECA [the general Committee for
Agricultural Co-operatives in the EC]. The dairy trade also has a
European organisation, [EDA - formerly ASSILEC] the European Dairy
Association, with representatives in Brussels. Each of these bodies
is able to obtain representation on the Commission's Milk Advisory
Committee, and through this channel farmers and industry marketing
organisations can exercise influence on proposals to be made to the
Council as well as on the implementation of policy by the
Commission.</p>

   
 <b>Choice of instruments</b> 
 : The author does not discuss alternative
instruments that might have achieved the CAP's' aims. The problems
met in formulating the common policy for milk are referred to as
follows (ibid, p.31):    </p>
<p>
 
    
   It took
the original Six members of the Community eleven years to achieve a
common policy for milk and the other major commodities of cereals
and beef. In the milk sector each member state had differing levels
of protection for milk producers and different methods of achieving
it. In Germany and the Netherlands the liquid milk market and the
manufacturing or industrial milk market were separated with
elaborate methods of pooling prices between the two to obtain the
producer price. In order to establish free trade within their
borders the Six had to harmonise support prices and intervention
measures, eliminating border taxes and controls between themselves
in transitional steps, and establish a common level of tariffs on
imports of dairy products from third countries in matching steps.
Export refunds had to be established and harmonised  <i>pari
passu.</i>   The transitional system
introduced a mechanism with a set of intra-Community levies on
trade to be gradually eliminated in a series of steps as external
tariffs and internal intervention measures were harmonised.
Agreement in this process was achieved by the gradual alignment of
the level of protection afforded by measures in the highest-price
country.    </p>
<p>
 
<br></p>
<p>   
 <b>Conduct of delivery agents</b> 
 : The Williams paper is a  
  <i>tour de force</i>  
 in its discussion of the implementation of the
milk policy in the different member countries of the EU. There is a
three tier system of implementation:</p>
<p class="blocktext">...at the first level are the Community
institutions that are involved in policy making and objective
setting, as well as in the implementation process. At the second
level are the institutions of national governments [15 of them]
each having some flexibility, albeit limited, in operating the
system. At the third level are the marketing agencies who are
responsible for their own strategies in a competitive market, and
are affected by the normal factors in a market
Structure-Conduct-Performance relation of investment, economies of
scale, product differentiation, advertising and brand loyalty,
research and development, and consumer demand for dairy
products.</p>

<p>The different attitudes of the bureaucracies in
member states to quotas have given rise to much variation in milk
prices (pp.77, 109): </p>
<p class="blocktext">...the amount of variation in the system throughout
the Community is very considerable. ....At one extreme, the
Republic of Ireland has generally had the lowest price with prices
sometimes below 90 per cent of the Target Price i.e. below the
intervention milk equivalent price. At the other, Italian producers
have had prices estimated to be as high as 130 per cent of the
Target Price...Ranges of this magnitude and variability could not
reasonably have been said to have been the intention of the
original designers of the policy who sought to eliminate variations
that might occur through any arrangements that would protect local
liquid milk prices. Explanations of price differences are complex
and may relate to many structural differences between countries,
the size of the processing/marketing organisations and economies of
size, product differentiation, brand loyalty, and the management
and ownership of marketing organisations.</p>

<p><b>Performance in terms of original aims</b>  : Williams finds that
the  <i>average</i> target prices achieved from 1989 to 1995 over
the 8 member countries were very near to that aimed for but that
there was marked variation between countries [as discussed above].
He notes average farm incomes have risen from 1978/79 to 1990/91
while the target price measured in ECUs moved very little. He
attributes the positive structural changes which have taken place
to the quota system and assistance for &lsquo;outgoers&squo;. Most member
states have succeeded in keeping to within one per cent of their
national reference quantities in most years. There are also other
comments on efficiency, enforceability and equity, which generally
suggest that the original aims of the policy are being
met.</p>

 <h2>Summary</h2> 
<p>This study presents a sympathetic and
positive view of the EU milk policy which is broadly seen to be
carrying out the aims originally enacted. By separating the
delivery of the policy aims from the aims themselves, the author
brings a new focus to the conduct and performance of a given policy
initiative. He concludes that to be effective, analysts should
always start with the aims and objectives of given policies and
recognise that when they have been absorbed into a hard-fought-for
constitutional agreement [the Treaty] they will be very hard to
change indeed.</p>

<h2><u>The demise of the New Zealand [NZ] Wheat Board</u> </h2>
 
<p>Marketing boards are legislative instruments set up
to control fluctuations in prices and production ostensibly in the
interests of producers. The NZ Wheat Board was established in 1965,
in a process of consolidation of previous market interventions with
powers, not unlike those of EU milk policy, to balance production
and imports of wheat, determine farmers' prices, determine milling
and manufacturing margins, and to recommend the price of bread to
Government. In the discussion that follows, the Government of NZ is
taken as the principal, the Wheat Board is the agent responsible
for administering the policy, and the constituents are the wheat
producers, the private millers, the private manufacturers using
flour, wholesalers and retailers selling products with flour
ingredients, and consumers. The same questions are asked of the
original sources. </p>
   
 <p><b>Aims of the enacting legislation</b>: The NZ Wheat
Board was set up by Act of Parliament in 1965 to rationalise and
co-ordinate wheat production and imports and regulate the prices
and quantity of flour. The Board was
required:</p>
<ol><li>to control the acquisition and marketing of wheat
and flour generally; </li>
<li>to encourage wheat growing and the use of wheat
grown, having regard to the best use of land available, the cost of
imported wheat, conservation of overseas funds, and other relevant
considerations; </li>
<li>to ensue that adequate supplies of wheat and
flour were available; and </li>
<li>to promote and organise the orderly development
and greater efficiency of the wheat and flour milling
industries.</li></ol>

<p><b>Consultation at the enactment phase of the legislation</b>: There was a
considerable history of intervention before 1965. A wheat purchase
board had been created in 1933 with power to purchase all wheat and
fix prices to the growers and millers, but not on imports. In 1936,
a Wheat Committee was formed to take over sole responsibility for
the buying and selling of all wheat, including imports. Price
controls were introduced in 1939 for the wheat, flour and bread
sectors. In 1962, a Commission of Enquiry was instituted and it
recommended the consolidation of the existing arrangements,
including price control, in a new enabling Act. A commission of
enquiry approach suggests that interested pressure groups were
fully consulted in the public process of consultation, though the
sources are silent on the design aspects of the legislation itself
[In practice, in the NZ parliamentary system, legislation is framed
by the bureaucrats and interested parties have only limited access,
but access nethertheless, at the Select Committee stage of a
Bill.]</p>

<p><b>Choice of instruments</b>: Two literature sources do not discuss
alternative instruments that might have been available at the
design stage (Sandrey and Reynolds 1990, Nixon 1993). Documentation
of alternative instruments discussed at the time would be hidden in
departmental archives. It is significant that both sources mostly
document needed changes to the legislation after the legislation
was no longer fulfilling its aims. They do not analyse whether the
original aims of the legislation were met in the intervening
period.</p>

<p><b>Conduct of the delivery agents</b>: The NZ Wheat Board
administered the legislation from 1965 to 1987 and from 1980 had to
meet an increasing number of regulatory changes introduced by the
Government. The documents consulted rather indicate that the Board
as the Government's agent was faithful to the objectives laid down
for them but that external events overtook them (Sandrey and
Reynolds 1991, p.127):</p>
<p>The key decision concerned the purchase price of
wheat from farmers, a price set to recoup all Wheat Board costs, as
this subsequently triggered other decisions such as the consumer
price of flour. Each flour miller was paid the calculated cost of
processing wheat into flour. These costs were independently
calculated for each mill, leaving millers with limited commercial
interest in the price of wheat. Indeed the only Board members who
had a strong commercial interest in the price paid for wheat were
the farmers. The Board maintained a pricing policy designed to
encourage domestic production of wheat and, therefore,
self-sufficiency.</p>

<p><b>Prices</b>: The sources are not precise on the course
of producer prices, import replacement prices and prices of
alternative enterprise products during the Board's administration.
It appears that Australian wheat could be landed in NZ more cheaply
than equivalent NZ grown wheat in most years and that pastoral
products [especially lamb production] were competing for the same
land<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym" id=
"sdfootnote6anc">6</a></sup> . The Board
was thus forced into large imports of Australian wheat [up to
100,000 tonnes in some years] to meet its adequacy
commitments.</p>

<p>In the event, the Government removed price control
on bread in 1980, introduced a producer price based on a three year
average of landed Australian prices in 1981, abolished flour, bran
and pollard price control in 1984, and eventually required that the
Board cease trading in 1987.</p>

<p><b>Performance in terms of the original aims</b>: The original aims were
focused on producer welfare with the market system being driven by
producer price negotiations with Government. One commentator stated
(Ali 1993):</p>

<p>It was very much a supply driven system, emanating
from the growers, whereas consumers were largely tamed by
regulations.</p>

<p>The legislation was enacted in a period when
intervention in markets was highly fashionable among politicians
and bureaucrats. The interesting feature of the legislation is that
a once-removed marketing agency was chosen to administer the
policy, which, in other areas, was carried out in administrative
departments. The Board consisted of representatives from Government
[including the chairman], and industry representatives from
producers, millers and bakers. The Board was handicapped by its
charter with its emphasis on encouraging domestic wheat growing
which the Board interpreted as promoting self-sufficiency (Nixon,
p.23). Finally the Board had to negotiate a producer price with the
farmers' interests that still required approval by Ministers. The
conclusion must therefore be reached that it was the structure that
was at fault and not the agency administering the policy. This is,
of course, contrary to the views given in the documents and the
popular view of events in the period concerned. But it does confirm
the Williams view that policy delivery must be examined in its
context, and not judged out of context!</p>

<p>Without regulation of prices and margins, there has
been a reduction in the farmers' interest and an increase in the
power of the millers and bakers. The position of the millers and
bakers has been enhanced by amalgamation and take-overs and
increased market power. The system is now driven by quality
considerations in both grain and flour and by baking techniques.
The price system is driven by international prices and competitive
forces within the industry. The quality and diversity of products
has increased considerably (Nixon 1993).</p>

<h2><u>Concluding observations <sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" id=
"sdfootnote7anc">7</a></sup></u> </h2>
<p>The major problem with an analysis of this sort is
to encompass a wide enough set of institutional experience to make
generalisation possible. This analysis is more of a framework for
further work than a full testing of such a hypothesis. </p>
<p>While the viewpoint of agricultural policy
implementation has been adopted, the analysis should be robust
enough to cover a wide range of economic policy experience. The
test is whether transaction cost theory `explains' what happens in
different countries and parliamentary systems? The evidence
reviewed and other literature suggests that policy making and
implementation is a political process where information and
expected effects on constituents are important considerations, and
that these characteristics are fairly universal across countries
and parliamentary systems. </p>
<p>The lesson to be learned is to evaluate past
policies in their own context and ask the right questions. The
institutional/structural design of a policy is therefore important.
The relationship between the legislators and the constituents [to
use Horn's terminology] has an effect on design and implementation.
Bindings made on successors and on implementers may be introduced
to improve the acceptance of the policy. Consultation will affect
the choice of alternative policy instruments. It is in this sense
that &lsquo;institutions&rsquo; or &lsquo;structure&rsquo; are most important in the
evaluation of policy initiatives and programmes.</p>
<p>The main theoretical support for evaluation comes
from transaction cost economics as applied to public
administration. An effective evaluation should ask what are the
policy attributes that bring the different actors together? What
impediments have to be overcome? How do the actors work together to
find solutions? How lasting is the legislative design? What public
agency implications are there? Are monitoring processes set up and
so on?</p>
<p>From the author's experience, the task of  <i>ex post</i>  
 policy evaluation is a job most civil service
organisations should be engaged in but very often are not! Analysts
would be considerably aided if they were provided with a set of key
questions to ask. Civil service managers have their attention
directed elsewhere. Judgements on the need for change in a policy
programme may come from both the political clientele and/or the
bureaucrats who manage it. The information balance is heavily
weighted in favour of the bureaucrats, especially where they have
monitoring systems in place. In forming policy proposals, the
economist's contribution is diluted by other generalists and legal
people who actually write the parliamentary bills. The bills
themselves are then subject to political compromises which further
confuse the original economic aims. The choice of instruments is
extensively debated by bureaucrats but may be changed in the final
decision making process after further political consultation. A
pure economic approach is not possible, hence the the political
preference function is not clearly expressed in economic
terms.</p>
<p>In recent years, formal
proposals for evaluation and review for policy programmes have been
systematically introduced in New Zealand <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym" id=
"sdfootnote8anc">8</a></sup> . While
introduced in the name of increased accountability, there is also
increased concern for [private] compliance
costs and distributive effects of
policy change. There has also been a political interest in the
permanency of policy change with the introduction of the Fiscal
Responsibility Act and other longer term policy issues such as the
funding of old age pensions <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym" id=
"sdfootnote9anc">9</a></sup>.</p>
<p>New Zealand developments might be compared with
Australia in this respect. In 1973, the Industries Assistance
Commission was established, on the recommendation of Sir John
Crawford, to advise the Federal Government on assistance which
should be given to, or withdrawn from, industries in Australia.
Crawford identified the following reasons for establishing the
Commission (Uhrig 1983, p.4): </p>

<ul><li>to assist the Government to develop policies for
improving the allocation of resources among industries in
Australia; </li>
<li>to provide advice on those policies in an
independent and disinterested manner; and </li>
<li>to facilitate public scrutiny of these
policies.</li></ul>  
    
<p>The Commission was to report
back on matters referred to it but could also initiate enquiries
under certain circumstances. The Commission later became the
Industries Commission and then the Productivity Commission. While
the focus was on the need for industry assistance, there is an
implication in the aims of the legislation that the implementation
of the policy and the suitability of the instruments should be
assessed <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote10anc"
href="#sdfootnote10sym" id="sdfootnote10anc">10</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Australia introduced Regulatory Impact Statements
(RIS) earlier than in New Zealand. A RIS must be prepared for all
new or amended regulations that directly or indirectly affect
business, or restrict competition. A RIS should be prepared early
in the policy development process, and should set out (among other
things), the options (regulatory and/or non-regulatory) that may
constitute viable means of achieving the desired objective[s], an
assessment of the impacts (cost and benefits) on consumers,
business, government and the community of each option, and a
consultation statement (Productivity Commission 1998). According to
the Productivity Commission report, compliance with RIS
requirements for Bills introduced into Parliament in 1997-98 was
mixed. An Impact Statement was tabled in most cases where required,
and generally the level of analysis was adequate. However, the
requirement to provide a RIS to the decision maker was complied
with in only about a third of cases (ibid, p.33).</p>

<h2><u>Annex 1: Policy Review Procedures in the New
Zealand Government System</u></h2>
<p>1. Departmental: Until recently there were no formal
requirements. Cabinet papers making new proposals or proposed
adjustments to previous legislation required a background statement
of previous enactments and cross-references. The reasons for change
were expected to emerge from such a statement. Design of
instruments should be addressed if relevant. Consultation was not
mandatory [but see 2 below]. Background papers based on a form of
structure/conduct/performance were optional but were not a
requirement. Background papers could be contracted out. Ministers
seldom involved in formal consultation, but Select Committees of
the House of Representatives may call for submissions on
legislative enactments. </p>
<p>2. Regulatory Impact
Statements <sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" id=
"sdfootnote11anc">11</a></sup> : As of July
1 1998, all policy proposals submitted to Cabinet which result in
government bills or statutory regulations must be accompanied by a
Regulatory Impact Statement, unless an exemption applies. The
Statement should consistently examine potential impacts arising
from government action and communicate the information to
decision-makers. Completion will provide an assurance that new or
amended regulatory proposals are subject to proper analysis and
scrutiny as to their necessity, efficiency, and net impact on
community welfare. The Statement should contain the following
information:</p>
<p>
 
 a. a statement of the nature and magnitude of the
problem and the need for government action; </p>
<p>
 
 b. a statement of the public policy
objective; </p>
<p>  
   
   c. a
statement of  <i>feasible options</i> 
 [regulatory and/or non regulatory] that may
constitute viable means for achieving the desired
objective(s);    </p>
<p>d. a statement of the  <i>net benefit</i> 
 of the proposal, including the total
regulatory costs [administrative, compliance, and economic costs]
and benefits [including non-quantifiable benefits] of the proposal,
and  <i>other feasible options</i> 
 ; and    </p>
<p>e. a statement of the  <i>consultative programme</i> undertaken.</p>
<p>[presumably the statement of net benefits
could be followed up in an  <i>ex post</i>  
 sense at a later date and comparisons
made].</p>

<p>3. The Audit Office <sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote12anc"
href="#sdfootnote12sym" id="sdfootnote12anc">12</a></sup> : The Audit
Office exists as a constitutional safeguard to maintain the
financial integrity of New Zealand's parliamentary system of
government. The Audit Office, as an Office of Parliament, is
independent of the executive branch of government. The Office's
role is to assist Parliament to strengthen the effectiveness,
efficiency, and accountability of the instruments of government.
This role is discharged by providing reports on whether public
sector organisations operate, and account for their performance, in
a manner    <i>consistent with Parliament's intentions</i>  . The
outcomes sought are that Parliament and the public will be
confident that public sector organisations are: 
<i>delivering what they have been asked to</i> 
 ; have operated lawfully and honestly, and
have not been wasteful; and have fairly reported their performance
in their statements of account (italics
added).</p>
<p>4. The Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory Unit:
Crown companies are fully owned registered companies subject to the
Companies Act 1993 but where the shareholding is still held by two
Ministers of the Crown. The Crown Company Monitoring and Advisory
Unit (CCMAU) was established in 1993 to ensure that the investment
is performing to the best of its ability, to collect information on
performance of the companies, and to provide advice to Ministers.
CCMAU is an independent unit attached to the Treasury department.
CCMAU's approach is to maximise the performance of the individual
companies in which the Crown has an ownership interest.. To meet
this objective from a company-level perspective, CCMAU (1998) focuses on: </p>
<p>a. the formation,  <i>structure</i>, investment and continued ownership of individual companies,</p>
<p>b. business strategy and the associated  <i>risks and opportunities</i>,</p>
<p>c. ensuring the most qualified directors are recommended for appointments,</p>
<p>d. <i>performance</i>, in absolute terms, against benchmarked companies,</p>
<p>e. the <i>impact</i> of government policy and regulation on <i>individual</i>  companies or groups of companies, and    </p>
<p>f. innovation,  <i>best practice</i>  and continuity of essential services (italics added).</p>

Agricultural Policy in Washington, USA (NCFAP 1994), are organisations which conduct public reviews of policy issues. The
work of James Q. Wilson in the United States follows a similar course but focuses more on regulatory activity and organizational
culture than the delivery of policy outcomes (Wilson 1980, 1989). The work of Horn (1995) belongs to the Wilson school.</p>

<div id="sdfootnote4">
<p> <a name="sdfootnote4sym" href="#sdfootnote4anc" id="sdfootnote4sym">(4)</a> There is nothing new in this. Tinbergen
(1956) prescribes the following procedures for an ideal analytical process: (1) the policy maker should pursue an agreed-upon set of
values; (2) the aims of the policy should be clearly formulated in advance of choosing among alternative policies; (3) the policy
maker should attempt a comprehensive overview of policy problems and of alternative policies; (4) coordination of policy should be
made an explicit function of the policy maker; and (5) economists as policy analysts should be comprehensive in considering economic
variables and values. For a critique of this approach see Braybrooke and Lindblom (1963, pp.38-39).</p>

<div id="sdfootnote5">
<p> <a name="sdfootnote5sym" href="#sdfootnote5anc" id="sdfootnote5sym">(5)</a> Peter Bushnell (New Zealand Treasury) has
pointed out to me that bureaucrats have a vested interest too in the commitment problem. Policy advice is often larded with little
reminders that certain steps taken will change the direction of future fiscal commitments [like tying NZ old age pensions to the
cost of living rather than the standard of living!].</p>
</div>
<div id="sdfootnote6">

equivalent Australian price though not in other years.</p>

<div id="sdfootnote7">
<p> <a name="sdfootnote7sym" href="#sdfootnote7anc" id="sdfootnote7sym">(7)</a> It should be made clear that this discussion
is principally about government economic programmes as applied to agriculture. It needs to be tested whether the framework would be

<p> <a name="sdfootnote8sym" href="#sdfootnote8anc" id="sdfootnote8sym">(8)</a> Formal review of policy is

carried out by the Australian National Audit Office. These are strong on administrative detail about implementation and alignment
with professed objectives, but are not critical of policy per se. Since 1997, Regulation Impact Statements have been mandatory for all Commonwealth legislation
that has the potential to affect business. &ldquo;The costs and benefits of regulation are to be weighed up carefully to ensure that the
putative [supposed] benefits are not outweighed by excessive economic and financial costs, including the compliance burden on
business&rdquo; (Prime Minister Howard 1997).</p>
