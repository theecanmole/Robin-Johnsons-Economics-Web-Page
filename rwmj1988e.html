<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="abstract">This paper reviews changes in the agribusiness sector since
1984. Evidence is based on available statistics and some
anecdotal information. Considerable changes are identified in
factor markets, input markets and service markets. Main features
include rapid increases in factor productivity, stabilization of
service prices (except interest), a decline in investment and a
decline in balance sheet assets. Amalgamation and restructuring
has occurred in the input and service industries and surplus
capacity still exists at several points. Outputs can only be
maintained at current high levels by disinvestment in the capital
base. The agribusiness sector is likely to settle down at some
new lower level of output and investment with increased levels of
productivity in the medium term.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This paper is concerned with the adjustment in New Zealand
agribusiness. This is interpreted to mean economic changes in
the micro-economy of agriculture as opposed to the more macro
matters considered in the previous paper. By agribusiness we
mean all those industries concerned with agricultural products
from farm to final consumer although data and length
considerations restrict the coverage mainly to the production,
input and service industries of agriculture in New Zealand. The
approach taken is to review changes in the factor, input and
service markets to ascertain where changes in economic direction
have occurred or where prices of resources or services have
undertaken adjustment in response to recent policy and market
environment changes. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical
materials are drawn from "Situation and Outlook for New Zealand
Agriculture, 1988" (MAF, 1988).</p>
<p class='center'>103</p>
<h2>Factor markets</h2>
<p>The area farmed in New Zealand has not shown much change in
recent years. There is a major adjustment, however in the total
area farmed as land has been transferred from the Department of
Lands and Survey to the Department of Conservation. The number
of holdings continues to rise. This appears to be more to do
with the coverage of the Statistics Department's questionnaire
than changes in the number of full-time farms. Some authors have
noted the emergence of a bimodal distribution of part-time small-
holdings and full-time farms (Fairweather, 1986; Schroder, 1987).
There are questions about the level of the real productive
capacity of the land resource, which is largely unmeasurable,
concerned as it is with fertilizer maintenance, weed control and
other capital asset maintenance procedures.</p>
<p>There is little evidence of a major shift of labour from the
farm sector. The number of working owners, full-time, part-time
and casual employees recorded at June 30 have not changed
perceptibily. There is, however, plenty of anecdotal evidence of
off-farm part-time working arrangements and an increase in the
number of working wives. Rewards for self-employed labour have
declined markedly.</p>
<p>There has been a massive change in the level of farm
investment (50% decline in nominal terms from 1985 to 1987). The
fall in land development investment is greater than in other
categories. This data therefore suggests that the capital base
of farming is not even being maintained, and must be in fact
declining at some as yet unmeasured rate. In the plant and
vehicle area, normal replacement is being delayed, the age of the
stock must be increasing, and greater maintenance costs are
likely to be required.</p>
<p>Since 1982 there has been a large decrease in land sales
values. As is well known, the large increase in land values in
the period 1977-82 was not markedly associated with any changes
in income earning capacity, but appears to be related to the then
current tax provisions, the availability of development funds at
concessional interest rates, and the floor price system then in
place. Movements in aggregate sales values since 1982 appear to
bear little relation to operating surplus, nominal GDP, real GDP,
or net farm incomes, except that money incomes have also declined
markedly since 1984-85.</p>
<p class='center'>104</p>
<p>In 1987 the all farm sale price index appears to have
stabilized after falling successively each year from 1982. Only
grazing farms were selling at less than their 1986 values. In
terms of butterfat and/or stock units 1987 land sale prices were
generally lower in 1987 than in calendar 1986.
These changes in land prices are reflected in the changing
capital structure of pastoral farms. On average the value of
land bUildings on sheep farms declined by 35% between 1984 and
1986 and on dairy farms by 19%. Market values of livestock have
also declined while the average level of liabilities has remained
constant on dairy farms but risen slightly on sheepfarms (to
1986). The cost of debt servicing has risen sharply under the
new regime and these major changes in farm balance sheets are
reflected in the following MAF data:</p>

<tr><td colspan='5'>Source MAF, 1988</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In 1987 the cost of debt servicing has risen further
(sheep/beef farms 26%) and presumably debt/equity ratios have
crept up a little further. The onslaught of deregulation was
felt sooner on sheep farms and the overall decline in incomes has
been greater. Presumably re-structuring of liabilities has not
yet been reflected in the above data.</p>
<p>As MAF points out, average debt/equity ratios do not reflect
what is happening at the margin. They state that in 1985-86, 24%
of sheep farms had less than 50% equity (ratio of one) and that
5% of all farms had zero or negative equity. These farms have
correspondingly higher levels of debt servicing - 24% of farms
had debt servicing levels of 41% in 1986. A level of 25% of
equity in total assets (equivalent to a debt equity ratio of
2.33) is considered to be the maximum position of exposure to be
aimed at. The adjustment of existing farmers to revised asset
valuations is a continuing process (well described by MAF) where
considerable sacrifice, off-farm working, and restructuring of
debt may all play a part.</p>
<p class='center'>105</p>
<p>Finally in the factor market sector, the above changes have
brought about a rapid increase in factor productivity since 1980.
In terms of real GDP per labour unit, there has been a 5.3% per
annum increase in factor productivity in total agriculture.
Since the land input ("capital") has possibly declined in the
last two years, total factor productivity has likely increased
faster than 5.3% in this period. In terms of physical output per
unit of physical current inputs, the Economic Service sheep farm
sector has increased productivity by 4.7% per year in the period
1980-1988, and by 9.3% per year since 1984.</p>
<p>In both measures quoted the rate of increase has risen still
higher in the period 1985-1988. This appears to be the normal
response of productivity ratios when the sector is contracting
and has been observed before by Philpott, Ross and Scobie. When
investment and current inputs surge upwards the productivity
ratios tend to fall.</p>
<h2>Input markets</h2>
<p>Fertilizer manufacture reached 2.5m tonnes in 1973 and 1974
and, after a cyclical decline in demand in the late 1970's,
reached 2.3m tonnes in 1980. There has been a steady decline
since 1980 in fertilizer output except in 1984-85. In the two
years following 1985, fertilizer manufacture has halved. It is
said the industry was operating at 50% of capacity in 1986 and
possibly down to 30% in 1987 (Hoggard, 1987). Recovery to an
output of 1.6 m tonnes was then thought possible i.e. around 58%
of installed capacity.</p>
<p>In 1970 there were 13 manufacturing plants owned by 5
companies of which 10 had survived in 1986. The above authority
believes 6 plants could now service the demand. Competition from
imports has been opened up and a nitrogen plant installed at the
gas field in New Plymouth.</p>
<p>This change in demand has had massive effects on
distributors, both on the ground and in the air. Latest figures
on the aerial spreading industry show a halving of flights and
hours flown between calendar 1985 and 1987. The number of
companies now involved has only declined marginally, though staff
numbers are much reduced.</p>

<p>Changes in other input markets can be examined indirectly by
breakdown of the intermediate inputs matrix of the national
income accounts. Between 1985 and 1988, nominal expenditure
increased by 3.8% with an actual decline in 1986 and 1987. In
real terms the value of inputs has fallen by 8% between 1984-85
and 1986-87. Changes in individual items in the input matrix from
1985 to 1987 in real terms are as follows:</p>

<p class='center'>107</p>
<p>Traditionally, the downturn in receipts has always been
reflected in the fertilizer and repairs and maintenance
industries, but the demand for inputs has also significantly
fallen in livestock purchases, feed and grazing, animal health,
freight, and overheads. Weed and pest control and fuel and power
demand have both risen in real terms. lower level of inputsThi~
also shows up as a lower level of demand for seasonal credit.</p>
<h2>Service markets</h2>
<h6>Processing</h6>
<p>For the last eight years the cost of processing/handling
meat, wool and dairy products has been under considerable market
and political pressure. In general, increases in these charges
have been well below the general rate of inflation.</p>

<p class='center'>108</p>
<p>In the period since 1984, there have been sharp increases in
slaughter charges for NI cow and in meat handling charges for
beef. Some of this charge may reflect the companies quoted by
the Meat Board and not reflect the general trend. The remainder
of meat processing charges have continued to be contained.
Processing costs in the dairy sector, have also risen steadily
since 1984, and tanker charges also nearly reach the general rate
of inflation. Freight costs on butter have been contained more
than adequately.</p>
<p>This containment of costs in the marketing channel is
clearly of considerable political and economic interest. Such
improvements would suggest major restructuring and productivity
changes in the processing sector, and this has been put forward
by a recent commentator (Rufus Dawe, Straight Furrow, 18 May).
Attempts to locate the real data have not been successful to
date.</p>
<p>In the meat industry there has been a major restructuring of
ownership and plant closures. Three large North Island plants
have been permanently or temporarily closed in the last three
years. On the other hand, the removal of licensing in the meat
industry has enabled 18 new processing plants to be opened or
started construction (Dominion, April 8). These changes must
bring about further rationalisation in due course, especially as
regards by-product and skin processing and disposal.
Considerable excess capacity currently exists and is being added
to.</p>
<p>Profitability in the meat industry is also down going by the
Waitaki International results. I understand farmers in the South
Island benefited from the high schedules offered there last
season, if not in the current season.</p>
<p>The exit of companies from the dairy processing sector has
been taking place over a long period, and there appears to have
been no recent acceleration in this trend. It is understood that
the rate of investment in dairy product processing continues at a
high level and this must auger well for the future.</p>
<h6>Stock Firms</h6>
<p>According to MAF statistics, trading bank advances to stock
firms have declined in the last 3 years. On the other hand,
stock and station advances to customers have risen steadily.
Customers credit balances with stock agents declined but deposits
for various terms have risen. This reflects a movement towards
interest earning opportunities encouraged by the stock firms.
Net debits of farmers with stock firms appear to have risen
appreciably in 1986, but fallen in 1987. These statistics
reflect very conservative management of funds and a lack of
expansion of credit in the industry as a whole due to lack of
demand. They also appear to conceal the bad debt situation and
the possible wide differences that exist between viable and
unviable accounts. Stock firms are required to participate in
re-structuring proposals.</p>
<p class='center'>109</p>
<p>There has, of course, been a major restructuring of the
number of agencies in recent years with the demise of one of the
traditional companies, but also with the entrance of a new
company from Australia. Recently, this company has announced
staff cuts of 150 in a total complement of 750 (Evening Post,
June 14). Considerable internal rationalisation is evident among
the existing companies, Knott, (1987) citing a reduction in staff
from 460 to 285 in his company (Williams and Kettle). It is
reported that more than 100 dealers in a farm equipment
distribution network (Tulloch's) have gone out of business in the
last two years (Dominion, June 9).</p>
<h6>Finance</h6>
<p>As with stock firms, statistics of trading bank advances to
farmers do not reflect the wide disparity in individual farm debt
situations. On average advances to the different types of
farmers (sheep, dairy, other and services) have not increased in
money terms since 1984 (MAF, Table 12). The trading banks have
been the conduit whereby major cost increases have been imposed
on farmers through interest rate policy.</p>
<p>There appears to have been a massive change in RBFC loan
authorisations (MAF, Table II). Total concessional loans have
dropped by two thirds from 1985 to 1987 with a major fall in
loans for land development followed by land purchase. In some
compensation, commercial lending by the RBFC doubled between
1985/86 and 1986/87, though total lending has sharply dropped.
Accounts in arrears increased from 5 percent in 1982/83 to 11.5
percent in 1986/87, while the provision for doubtful debts
increased from zero to $3.2 million. Interest rates to clients
have only been slowly increased towards market rates.
Since July 1986 there has been considerable restructuring of
loans by the RBFC. Some of this restructuring has involved
adjustment by other lenders as well. Applicants for
restructuring totalled 8099 and 4706 have been approved for
discounting, 699 restructured by other means and 2724 declined.
Of the 8099, 4798 were sheep farms, 2571 dairy farms and 730
other farms. Most importantly, the farmers discounted owed the
bank $696m prior to discounting of which $228m (33 per cent) or
$50,000 per farm was written off.</p>
<p>As at 31 March 1987, the RBFC had not restructured its own balance
sheet although the Minister of State Enterprises has stated
publicly that the Bank was in no state to be privatized. More
interesting perhaps, from the adjustment point of view, will be
the extent of the write-down of the bank's assets when the
accounts for the most recent financial year are finalized, and
the consequent adjustment of liabilities.</p>
<p class='center'>110</p>
<p>Landcorp has also introduced a restructuring programme for
its farmer mortgagees. Discounting is used to establish new debt
levels at around 70% of existing levels with an interest rate of
13%. Provision is made to "park" some of the debt interest-free
until July 1989. A cash settlement offer is also available (NZ
Farmer, April 27).</p>
<p>In the financial sector the question of entry and exit does
not appear to affect the competitive position of the existing
firms. The Reserve Bank (1986) argues that, apart from the RBFC,
financial institutions are not seriously threatened by the farm
debt problem, as rural lending represents a small proportion of
their total debt portfolio. This observation appears to overlook
the amalgamation and re-structuring of the major stock agency
firms in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
This paper was commissioned to review and analyse adjustment
in New Zealand agribusiness. The review has concentrated on
identifiable economic responses to recent policy and market
changes. Such a review does not reflect the degree of hardship
and stress that such changes involve. The OECD talks of
"positive adjustment" to identify appropriate policies to manage
change. New Zealand does have its share of positive adjustment
policies (discounting the prime example) but one is left with the
feeling that more should have been done to facilitate the change
from protectionism to full market exposure of the New Zealand
agricultural sector since 1984.
<p>Without doubt the major cost of adjustment has been borne by
the farmers themselves both in income and in equity terms. Some
sharing of the burden of adjustment is evidenced by the financial
sector arrangements and government backing for the Rural Bank.
There is evidence that pressure has been brought to bear on
some of the cost excesses in the marketing channel. This has
probably been achieved by increased productivity, restructuring
and reduction of profits. In current circumstances, these
pressures are likely to continue, with further rationalisations
and exits likely.</p>
<p>Output of the whole agricultural industry has largely been
maintained to date, but at the expense of capital stocks and
maintenance expenditures. This process must come to an end soon.
In the medium to longer term, the capital stock will fall, a new
lower level of outputs will be established, at lower expenditure
and maintenance levels, but at higher productivity levels. The
search for the right balance of market returns, exchange rates
and internal cost pressures will need to continue until the
appropriate position of the New Zealand tradeables sector is once
again clearly delineated and established.</p>
