<li><a href="rwmj2005b.html">'The Challenge of Native Title'</a> <br clear="all">
This paper was given to the Australian Agricultural Economics Society meeting in February 2005.
It continues the theme of the Torrens paper (below). The paper
compares <q>aboriginal title</q> in the Australian, Canadian and New
Zealand jurisdictions. The challenge lies in legal systems for
property ownership being brought up to date so as to recognise
indigenous customary title.</li>

<a href="rwmj2005c.html">'Institutional Aspects of Customary Land Rights'</a>. <br clear="all">
This paper, delivered to the NZ Association of Economists meeting on July 1, 2005, more closely
targets the <q>aboriginal law</q> arguments of earlier papers on this
topic. This doctrine, common to the High Courts of Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, has developed mechanisms and safeguards
for incorporating pre-colonial customary law in to the common law.
The original inhabitants of all three countries have been
beneficiaries of the doctrine in modern times.</li>

<li><a href="rwmj2003e.html">'Fisheries: Managing Property Rights'</a>. <br clear="all">
This paper was presented to the winter meeting of the
NZ Agricultural and Resource Economics Society in Blenheim, July
2003. NZ has an international reputation for its transferable quota
system for sea fisheries introduced in 1985. This paper examines
the administration of the quota system from the point of view of
transaction costs within the management process. The goals of fish
conservation and sustainability have been obtained by the scheme
but at a high level of transaction costs particularly with regard
to litigation over quota allocations. With the passage of time,
these setting-up costs are gradually left behind as the fishers
accommodate to mutual exchange of quota.</li>

<a href="rwmj2004f.html">'The Torrens Land Registration System and Customary Rights'</a> 
<br clear="all">This paper, delivered to the NZ Association of Economists in June 2004, is
concerned with recent debate in NZ about the ownership of the
foreshore and adjacent seabed in the colonial settlement process.
It appears that colonial legislation did not provide adequately for
Maori customary rights to some coastal land and nearby seabed. Such
rights were entrenched in and protected by the Treaty of Waitangi
1840. The Torrens system of land registration covers most land in
NZ and may protect both European and Maori land interests. The
debate was initiated by a Court of Appeal decision in 2003
indicating that customary rights may be reviewed by the Maori Land
Court on a case by case basis, i.e. that such rights had never been
extinguished. The paper shows that these customary rights lie
outside the Torrens system and will have to be assessed in the
light of modern aboriginal law as developed in Australia and
Canada.</li>

<li><a href="rwmj1992a.html">Resource management, sustainability and property rights: are our structures adequate?</a> (1992). 
<br clear="all"> This paper explores the application of property
rights to sustainable land management objectives. Property rights
are briefly defined and discussed in terms of the Torrens system of
land registration. Incentive schemes for soil conservation are
assessed against the property rights background. Alternative
systems of property rights are discussed after the manner of Bromley and Hodge. 
The application of such a changed system of property rights is assessed for practicality and technical
achievement.<br clear="all">

Proceedings of the Annual Conference New Zealand Association of Economists and the Agricultural Economics Society (NZ Branch), 24-26 August 1992. This paper explores the application of property rights to sustainable land management objectives. Property rights are briefly defined and discussed in terms of their characteristics including the principles of attenuation and efficiency. Their relationship to the Resource Management Act is then discussed in the context of its sustainability objectives. The future development of suitable regulations and incentives is assessed from a property rights point of view.</li>
