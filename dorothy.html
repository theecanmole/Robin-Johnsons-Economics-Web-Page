<h1>Dorothy E Johnson &#8212; A Memoir</h1>

<p class="blocktext csmall">&lsquo;Dorothy Johnson of Christchurch&rsquo;, a contribution to <i>Seeking a New Land: Quakers in New Zealand</i>, edited by James Brodie and Audrey Brodie, The Peachtree Press, Wellington, 1993.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do we remember and perceive from this distance in time?</p><ul>
<li>A widow surviving her husband by 12 years?</li> 
<li>A strong Christian though in the non-conformist tradition?</li> 
<li>A mother of five boys and eighteen grandchildren?</li> 
<li>A career person who had two professional periods of employment
interspersed with raising a family?</li> 
<li>A deaf old lady who insisted on attending meeting for worship even though she could no longer
hear? 
<li>Or perhaps just as a friend or acquaintance who could carry on a good conversation in spite of her hearing impediment?</li>
</ul>
<p>This memoir will set down the facts of
Dorothy's background first, and then go on to assess her as a
person both through the eyes of her friends and aquaintances and of
her family. The objective will be to establish Dorothy as a
person in the environment in which she grew up and
matured rather than dwell on any particular aspect of her life.</p>

<p>Dorothy came of Devon stock though her
family had been living in London before they emigrated to New Zealand
in 1900. [Her parents are identified in Figure 1.] <p>Her father was
a butcher by trade and may have been helped to emigrate by W &amp;
R Fletchers (Vesteys), his first employer in New Zealand.</p> 
<p>Dorothy herself remembered the end of the Boer War as their ship was
anchored in Cape Town.</p>

<p>The precise dates are not certain but the
family remembers that Mr Timewell had a butcher's shop in
Devonport; they lived at 50 Church St.; and later had a butcher shop in
Whangarei. In the mid-thirties Wreford Timewell was Mayor of Whangarei.</p> 
<p>Dorothy's sisters and brothers settled in the
Auckland area, except for Norah who went to live in Sydney (Mrs
Cunningham), and Kathleen (Mrs Reg Newton) who married a returned
serviceman farmer and settled near Te Kuiti in the 1920s.</p>

<p>Dorothy must have finished her primary
education in Devonport and she herself records that she gained entry
to Auckland Girls Grammar School through a scholarship in
1904 at a time when secondary education was not free. In 1907 Dorothy won a senior scholarship which presumably entitled her 
to continue at Auckland Grammar.</p> 
<p>She records that she was unsuccessful at the Junior University Scholarships in 1909, and that
she became a Pupil Teacher in 1910. She passed a D Certificate in 1910 and a C Certificate in 1911.
 In 1912 she was admitted to Auckland Teacher's College as a trainee (apparently
for one year) as she was teaching at the Queen Victoria School for Maori Girls in 1913.</p>

<p>These facts suggest that Dorothy's family
were not particularly supportive of higher education and possibly
that at this period they were not well off enough to support
Dorothy. As Dorothy's education took her away from her family
they appear to play a lesser role in her life than if she had
stayed in the Auckland area.</p>

<p>In spite of her earlier failure, Dorothy won a scholarship to Otago University in 1914 to study Home
Science. She completed the degree of B.H.Sc. in 1916. She remembers the stern Scottish professors of that day teaching physics,
chemistry and biology and appears to have received a very thorough training in the basic sciences as well as home science. 
Some of the laboratories were housed in a tin shed which apparently survived long after her time at Otago. There are photos of the &quot;old tin shed&quot; and the family have a tape
recording made in later life recording her impressions of this period.</p>

<p>During this period, Dorothy met her future husband John Johnson,
who like her was a student teacher who was paying his own way through Otago University studying
economics. His background was strictly non-conformist, his father having
been an early immigrant to New Zealand around 1862. His father&acute;s brother, Samuel Johnson, arrived on the <i>Matilda
Wattenbach</i> in 1863 and went with &lsquo;the Albertlanders&rsquo; to Kaipara Harbour for a
period. John's mother was a Danish maidservant in Government House who had married Thomas Johnson somewhat later in his life. John and his sister Hannah were born in the mid 1880's.</p>

<p>It seems clear that the period 1914 to 1916
was a very stimulating time in both Dorothy's and
John&acute;s lives. There was the communality of student life at Otago,
their common Christian beliefs and associations, and their many
friends and aquaintances who were studying theology, medicine and
dentistry at the time.</p>

<p>Knox College &#8212; where John was a tutor for a
time &#8212; clearly provided a focal point for these
activities. As a child I remember the Knox College tea service
presented to my parents sitting in its cabinet but never used.</p>

<p>John Johnson enlisted in the army in 1915 and was away from New Zealand until 1919 when he was invalided
home from France with suspected Tb.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dorothy had taken a job at
Napier Girls High School and found herself planning and
equipping the first science laboratories at the school.
The knowledge imparted by the Scottish professors turned out to be
useful. Presumably Dorothy was supporting herself at this time.</p> 
<p>In 1919 she returned to Auckland to teach at Auckland Girls Grammar
School, and on the 9th June 1919 Dorothy married John at Holy
Trinity Church, Devonport. They then set out for Dunedin where he had a job offer 
in adult education at the University of Otago.</p> 
<p>She obtained a job under Dr Malcolm in the Physiology
Department of the University Medical School in which it was proposed to
carry out an analysis of indigenous New Zealand foods starting
with fish. As a result of this work two papers were published in
the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute (later the Royal
Society).</p>

<p>In June 1921 Wreford Neil Johnson was born
and Dorothy's working life came to an end for the time being. In 1926 John accepted a position as an
adult education tutor at Canterbury University and the family (now
consisting of 3 boys) moved first to a rented house in St Albans and then
to the Pascoe house on Clifton Hill in Sumner which they bought.</p>

<p>Two more boys were born and the family settled down to educational demands, a tiring job one
hour's tram ride away, and a lack of ready income due to the cuts in
salaries instituted by the Forbes government. John Francis was enrolled at Friends School in Wanganui in 1935, Eric and Robin
in 1937 and Thomas in 1939. In due course all the boys passed through Christchurch Boys High School.</p>

<p>In 1937 John was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship to study adult
education in the United States. Money was borrowed to allow Dorothy to accompany him and the boys were
placed with friends and sent to boarding school. John and Dorothy attended the World Conference of the Society of Friends at
Swarthmore College and travelled to England on the Queen Mary. Dorothy recalls that they looked for her childhood home but could not
find it. John had wanted to stay in England in 1919 after the
war to further his studies but his ill-health prevented this.</p>

<p>This visit was no doubt arranged by Professor Shelley, the
head of the Education Department at Canterbury University to whom
John was responsibIe. On the return from the United States
Professor Shelley had moved to Wellington to be head of the
Broadcasting Service and his place was taken by Professor Field.</p> 

<p>With other changes in adult education taking place, the latter had a
different view from Shelley and began to make John's life very
uncomfortable; the upshot of this was that John resigned from
the University in 1940 and sought employment elsewhere. From then until his retirement
in 1950 he had several jobs in secondary
schools finishing up with the Correspondence School in Wellington.</p>

<p>Dorothy stressed that she was asked to take up her next two offers of employment. 
These marked her return to the work force and second period of professional work.</p> 
<p>In 1938 she was asked to teach home science at Avonside Girls High
School in Christchurch, concentrating on the top forms and
including the subject area &lsquo;diet of the pre-school child&rsquo;. In 1939 she moved to Christchurch West High School with similiar duties. She mentions working with boys classes and the staff of the woodwork
class to furnish and decorate a model room.</p>

<p>Her next step, in 1940, was to apply for and obtain an appointment as Tutor-Organiser for rural
women's education with Auckland University. This appointment was to cover the province 
of Auckland.</p> 
<p>The post had been established in conjunction with Country Womens Institutes, the Womens'
Division of Federated Farmers and the National Council of Women. 
Dorothy stayed in this post until some time in 1943 when she
returned to Clifton to look after the secondary schooling of
the two younger boys.</p>

<p>Of this period she notes that her job directions included elements of sex education and that she
first tried it out in a sole charge school in the country. She met the mothers after the school session to have the process
explained to them.</p> 
<p>This was clearly a very demanding job, involving a great deal of travel, absence from Clifton for a long period, but
nevertheless very innovating.  Many people benefitted from her courage and willingness to bring something extra to
their lives.</p> 
<p>The author was later to benefit from this work when he
visited one of the host farms in the Bay of Plenty in the early
1950s.</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<i>My parents in Edgecumbe were involved
with the WEA in those years. Dorothy used to stay at our house
on her visits. My parents found her a breath of fresh air
and a great change from breaking in a farm on the
Rangitaiki Plains. It meant a great deal to them and they felt, as I
do, that it was a privilege to have her in the house and
to know her.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="ind">Helen Lewis nee McLean</p>

<p>By this time Dorothy's family had spread its
wings. John was teaching in Oamaru and then in Wellington. Neil was working on a farm at Hamner after registering as a concientious objector; John F was working as a cooper in
Christchurch and then for the Ministry of Works at Hundalee also after
registering as a concientious objector; Eric finished secondary school and started 
a fishing career in Lyttelton, while Robin
and Thomas were brought home from Friends' School to live
at Clifton and finish secondary school.</p> 

<p>The home at Clifton was maintained throughout 
this period though not everybody could be
there at any one time. It was a period of uncertainty for the
family due to the war mainly but also due to the exigencies of
earning a living in what was by now a hostile employment
environment. In 1944 the Friends Ambulance Unit recruited Neil and John
Francis to serve for two years service in China.</p>

<p>Dorothy took a new lease on life after
this. In 1945 she was appointed to the first group of rural
sociologists in the Department of Agriculture.</p> 

<p>The Rural Development Division had been created in 1944 with the intention of developing
a broad based service agency for rural people
including adult education and social research. In this capacity Dorothy travelled throughout Canterbury and the West Coast
working with Countrywomens' groups, servicing the
Department's winter schools, broadcasting and writing for the Journal of
Agriculture. The Rural Sociology section established the
Country Girls' Clubs' movement in this period.</p> 
<p>Dorothy's booklet &lsquo;The Child and his Family&rsquo; was first published in the Journal and
later reprinted twice. The experience with Country Girls' Clubs was written up
by Rosemary Craven for a social work thesis at Victoria University.</p>

<p class="blocktext"><i>&ldquo;There is a framed photograph in my
dining room taken by Dorothy's grandson. It shows Dorothy and
two of her great-grandchildren, a toddler and a
preschooler, at a kitchen table. The two children are fully
absorbed together in an  experiment, it seems, to do with their
eyes. Equally  absorbed Dorothy looks on with pleasure.
This a clear  depiction of the value Dorothy gave to
the child's  development through play and to the
encouragement of a child's own powers of observation. 
 Remembering Dorothy, such phrases come to mind as 
<em>enquiring mind</em>, <em>breadth of interest</em>, <em>dry humour</em>, and 
 <em>justifiable pride in overcoming early difficulties and in 
 her achievments</em>. She enjoyed life
and was determined to live it to the full. My impression remains that Dorothy&acute;s contribution has not been sufficiently recognised by society in general&rdquo;.</i></p>

<p class="ind">Rosemary Craven</p>

<p class="blocktext"><i>&ldquo;I once heard Dorothy describe
herself as &lsquo;a second generation pioneer&rsquo; &#8212; how true!
Enterprise, ambition, hard work, and the vision to open up and succeed in new
fields. One of the first Home Science graduates,
nutrition worker when few had even heard of nutrition as
a science, teacher in a girls' school insisting on a
properly equipped laboratory for her science students,
innovative adult education educator, broadening the
horizons for town and country women, struggling for equity of
treatment and recognition against the male bastions of
the Department of Agriculture. One who combined marriage, motherhood
and career long before this was generally accepted &#8212;
or acceptable, trying out every new hearing aid, refusing to
let her disability prevent full participation in career,
community service, church and family. Role model, mentor and friend &#8212; 
how many lives she touched and enriched?.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p class="ind">Norma Taylor nee Metson, Rural Sociologist</p>

<p>Dorothy retired in 1951 on turning 60. She notes it was due to the change of government at the time! It
would be more fair to say that the demands of work were very
onerous and the public service was not the ideal place in which to
express one's own ideas and views. It is recorded elsewhere
that the Rural Sociology section was going through an
identity crisis of its own in this period [Carter book] and
Dorothy may have just had enough.</p>

<p>In 1951 Clifton was sold to Neil, and John and Dorothy moved to 262 Main Road, Moncks Bay. This was a
delightful old stone house in the corner of the bay with good views of
the estuary of the Avon and Heathcote Rivers. Here the hospitality that had started at Clifton in the thirties was continued
and Dorothy could look back at what she had accomplished over her
busy and varied life.</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<i>Although I was an infant when I first
met Dorothy at Sumner we didn't become friends until 1968 when
my husband and I,  with our two young children, came to
Christchurch on leave  from California. Dorothy and John had
moved by then to  Monck's Bay. Their beautiful sheltered
home under the cliff  by the sea was full of books, pamphlets,
striped Indian  Madras covers, bright cushions and good
old wood &#8212; warm,  welcoming, assured. After twenty years
overseas I had need  of the sense of place (allied with the
widest mental  vistas) that John and Dorothy provided.
Dorothy was  sensitive to need and generous and
unassuming in her  response. Learning that I was nervous
when doing large-scale entertaining she wrote out by
hand, in her clear distinctive writing, several pages of
delectable, yet simple and frugal. recipes which she had
herself developed in earlier years. I use them still &#8212;
especially the moussaka! In 1973 we were again on leave, this
time in Wellington, and Dorothy, now a widow, came often to
visit. She was a wonderful companion, eager for new
knowledge and ideas and generous in sharing her own accumulated
wisdom. Her laughter was frequent and infectious &#8212;
her deafness (so nobly borne) immaterial. She liked
sitting with a cup of tea in the sun to discuss things and to
be in the garden &#8212;  indeed the sun shone through her in those
days.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">Alison Rayner-Hooson</p>

<p>John's health declined in these years and he died at the age of 81 in 1968. 
In 1971 the house was sold and Dorothy went to live in a flat with son Eric at 24 Stoke St
Sumner. In 1977 Dorothy booked herself into Cavell House in Head St
Sumner where she died at the age of 88 on the 26th of July 1980.</p>

<p class="blocktext"><i>&ldquo;Dorothy Johnson, one of the graduates of
the School of Home Science, University of Otago,
greatly valued being made a life member of the Association of
Home Science Alumnae, New Zealand [in 1991]. I believe this was because she so fully embraced, both in theory
and in practice, the scientific, psychological and
sociological concepts embodied in the disciplines included in
the four year degree course. Dorothy considered that professional
work, especially teaching in its many forms, of prime
importance to women while still acknowledging their vital
role in family life. She was herself a gifted teacher and an
able writer. Her professional papers, gathered over a
lifetime of teaching, writing and continuing study, were a
vital part of her  life.  She was generous and enthusiastic in her
support of younger colleagues, including myself. She quickly established rapport with people of all ages as she had a deep interest in others and their aspirations. Her
sense of humour and fun, her lively mind and her continuing
interest in the world about her made her a valued friend
to those fortunate enough to know and love her.&rdquo;</i></p> 

<p class="ind">Mary Small</p>

<h2>Impressions</h2>

<p>Due to her deafness, Dorothy had a long
association with the League for the Hard of Hearing. She went
through many hearing aids of varying efficiency and noises off.
She was forever testing her batteries.She experimented with
all types of hearing aid that became available and no doubt
helped others in this way. [was she an office bearer in the League?]</p>

<p>Dorothy was the Quaker representative on
the National Council of Churches in the 1950s and 1960s and was
first lay vice-president of the Council. She was the Council
representative on the Maori section of the NCC. Tom Johnson recalls
that her Maori name was &lsquo;Kuia-koi&rsquo; which translates as
sharp old lady! Dorothy expressed her own views on these activities in the
following way:</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<em>To me working with and among members of
other churches is just the chance of showing the validity of
the Quaker point of view, especially the emphasis on the
Spirit or the Inward Light. Enabled by the spirit I seek
to recognise the Spirit in others, not misled by the
different garments and beliefs in which it is expressed, nor
desiring to impose my pattern as a condition of unity.
I find it an enriching experience to
discuss current religious matters and problems, making
decisions with able, dedicated people of very different.
backgrounds and training. I find it also that the development
of my understanding and friendship with other
members of the executive, month by month, brings a
first-hand experience of unity, a prophetic realisation in
miniature of the Council's purpose</em>&rdquo;.</p>

<p class ="ind">quoted from; &lsquo;What 'C'anst Thou Say?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Dorothy was on the Committee of Friends
School in the 1940s and 1950s, though long after, her sons had
finished their education there. With some courage she took part in
the decision to sell the school to the Social Welfare Department
in the 1960s.</p>

<p>Dorothy was brought up as an Anglican but
joined the Society of Friends along with John in 1936. In her
Testimony this significant change is well brought out:</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;...the Society ... is my home. It contains my chosen and beloved
family&rdquo;.</p> 
<p>It was her second and larger family, in fact, where she felt
secure, enjoyed the experiences of worship and work, the
intellectual stimulation of reading, study and
discussion and the delight when travelling overseas, in the
United States at Friends World Conference in 1937, and later
again in India. To this could be added the pleasure she
gained from and the contribution she made to the Annual General
Meetings and summer gatherings of the Society of Friends.</p>

<p>Meeting for Worship was a priority for her;
she loved coming, and attended regularly until three
weeks before she died. How many times did she bring new life
and depth to worship, often with a quotation from her
recent reading and her reflection on it?.</p>

<p>With her Anglican background, her
scientific training, her wide religious and philosophical reading,
her extensive circle of friends, Dorothy had a truly
catholic faith. She longed that the Society of Friends should
be open and accepting and appreciative of the different
gifts and practices of other denominations of the
Christian Church.</p>

<p>Her ability to befriend others and to bring them out of themselves was well known:</p>
<p>(Testimony)</p>
<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<i>Friendship with Dorothy was a
significant experience for a number of people of all ages and
conditions. For each she meant something very special and
personal. She was genuinely interested in each person, and
in loving relationship applied her keen mind and
close observation to helping people to gain fresh insight &#8212;
many young people in growing up had their special
relationship with Dorothy.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ind">(Phyllis Short, Testimony)</p>

<p>And from Wanganui:</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<i>She loved and enjoyed her books, her
pictures, her garden, her clothes, and it was very hard for
her to grow old, to lose her mobility, her capacity to read
for sustained periods, to write, to attend the
lectures and concerts which gave her so much pleasure, or to
visit far afield. How wonderful that it was made possible
for her to visit the Settlement so shortly before she
died ....... She was constant in giving of herself, tier
time, her attention, her keen mind, her love to people; and she
enjoyed them.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>(Testimony)</p>

<p>Tom Johnson's memories are of papers and still more papers:</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;<i>There were just miles and miles of it,
on book shelves, window sills, in boxes, under beds,
stuffed in corners behind chairs, in the spare bedrooms,
down the length of the hall and all of it carefully packed
and labeled denoting either John or Dorothy. If
anything ever happened to this paper, being knocked over, the
wind or cat getting at it, or someone just commenting on it
caused no end of upheaval ... It seemed as if their life
blood was wrapped up in these papers, and there was
unfinished work to bring their endeavours to fruition.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Envoi</h2>

<p>The questions were posed at the beginning 
of this memoir. The author sees in this manuscript a picture of
migrant families from the old world coming to terms with the new
world and the new colony. Particularly evident is the thrust
toward higher education from people with a relatively
humble background. Both John and Dorothy also provided for their
own education; their families contributed little. Secondly we
see the strong non-conformist streak in the two families
coming to a head in the full blossom of Quakerism. Although the
people concerned remain imprisoned in the conventions of their age
and background. They were in the vanguard of the most progressive
and liberal parts of society of their time.</p>

<p>The importance of family appears crucial at certain stages of their lives and on Dorothy's part at least
there is an an extension of family to the Society of
Friends. Dorothy was separated from her own extended family
early in life and yet wanted to return to it. She had a strong
partnership with John as shown by her dedication of &ldquo;What
Canst Thou Say&rdquo; to him. In many ways he was the leader in their
mission in life and she was the follower.</p>

<p>Let us leave the last word to Dorothy. She
laid particular stress on her need to win scholarships to gain
higher education; on her science background (unique in her
generation); on being asked to take up secondary school teaching again; on
the importance of early sex education; and her questioning
attitude to religion.</p>

<p>Truly a woman in advance of her time!</p>
