<h1>Whither the Crown Research Institutes? Funding Issues</h1>

<p class="by">By</p>
<p class="by">Robin Johnson<sup><a class='f' href=
"#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="abstract">In the course of another exercise (Johnson,
Scrimgeour &amp; Manning 2006) I compiled, with the help of CCMAU,
a financial record of the crown research institutes from 1992 to
2005. In this paper I thought I would share with this audience some
of the facts that emerged from the exercise and make some
observations about present and future trends in the organisation of
Research and Development funding in NZ. There has been a systematic clamour from the
agricultural institutes that the initial plans for the CRIs
discriminated against their activities. This led to job uncertainty
as well as a huge increase in transaction costs in the process of
obtaining funds. More recently, the activities of the agricultural
interests has seen a re-activation of forward planning for this
part of the science sector in the form of Dairy 21 an amalgamation
of Dexcel, Dairy Insight and Fonterra interests along with
AgResearch. In the meantime, the Government has yielded to CRI
pressure to modify the contestable model for science funding with
more emphasis on longer term planning and continuity for the
funding of the institutes. Most recently, scientists at Otago
University have pointed out that moves in this direction are likely
to be at the expense of university funding of Research and Development.</p>
<p class="center"><strong>Key Words:</strong> Crown Research
Institutes, Funding, Contestability.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) are the product of the
Upton reforms of the science industry in the early 1990s. They
replaced the research division of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries (later MAFTech) and all the divisons of the Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). The science reform
planners, possibly located in the Treasury mainly, were looking for
examples of government departments where the trading activities
could be put on a more commercial basis and savings in the fisc
could be made. The principal reform was the establishment of 10
subject area research institutes from the existing staff of the two
departments (plus the Meteorological Service) which would be run as
incorporated companies and which would be funded by a competitive
bidding process using the old departmental votes to start with. The
money was to be held and managed by the Foundation for Research,
Science and Technology (FRST) while a Ministry of Research, Science
and Technology was established for policy advice services
(MoRST).</p>
<p>Among the other aims of the reforms, was a desire to see less
emphasis on government funding of most NZ research activity and
increased participation by private industry. Areas such as
agricultural science which were mainly funded by government in the
past were told to look for alternative sources of funding. The
planners believed that high levels of government funding 'crowded
out' private sector participation (Johnson 2000)</p>
<p>In preparing the Johnson <em>et al</em> (2006) paper on trends
in public investment in agricultural research in 2005, we obtained
from the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU) a
semi-official record of the accounts of the nine remaining
institutes - the proposed institute of social research was
disbanded after one year. A summary of the data is presented in the
Appendix to this paper. This data set gives a good overview of the
financial tends within the institutes over the 10 years since the
reforms took place and helps to illustrate some of the
administrative problems which appear to have emerged.</p>

<p>MoRST held a review of PGSF funding in 1999 and identified some
of the research or 'output areas' where funding was lagging and the
reasons why. Some small changes in procedure were put in place.
Some of the institutes had been quite vocal in their criticism of
planning and more recently the dairy sector organisations have
taken up the challenge to increase funding of research hopefully
with increased contributions from the Government..</p>
<p>The paper discusses trends in funding and the crowding out issue
first and then goes on to discuss trends in agricultural research
funding and action. We conclude with some reference to government
statements on the issues canvassed and the changes in funding
arrangements which have been announced so far.</p>
<h2>Crowding Out</h2>
<p>The burden of the argument used by various commentators was that
excessive government funding of Research and Development effort was a disincentive
to the private sector investing in more Research and Development (Johnson 2000).
This proposition is not itself capable of proof but it is possible
to look at trends in funding by providers since then and determine
if the private sector has increased its participation. Table 1
shows the shares of Research and Development expenditure attributed to 'business',
government and the universities in the MoRST surveys from 1990-91
to 2003-04.</p>

<p>Going by this evidence there has been a slow shift in the
delivery of research away from government towards the universities
and the business sector. It should be noted that MoRST classifies
research associations as business, and CRIs as government.</p>
<p>Within the government sector, CRIs accounted for 45 per cent of
estimated Research and Development expenditure in 1992-93 and 36 per cent in
2003-04. Within the CRIs the source of funding was also shifting
away from government in some CRIs more than others. From 1993 to
2004 total revenue of the institutes increased by 57.8 per cent
(Table A1). NIWA increased by far more than this while HORT, FRI
and ESR<sup><a class='f' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
"">3</a></sup> did not fare so well. Overall, the share of PGSF
funding (as defined) fell from 62.6 per cent to 45.8 per cent. The
increase in PGSF funding was 15.5 per cent over the 11 years. Of
the institutes, NIWA, IRL, FRI, Landcare and ESR got more than
average while AgRes, HORT and CROP fell behind . NON PGSF funding
increased by 128 per cent with AgRes, NIWA, CROP, and GNS being the
leaders and HORT, IRL, FRI, and ESR being less adventurous.</p>
<p>Thus AgRes, NIWA, CROP and GNS have followed the Treasury mantra
and gone out and actively sought non-government funding. Whether
this is a welfare improvement or just a saving on the fisc needs
investigating. The main fact is that a far greater proportion of
CRI income is derived from non-PGSF sources.</p>
<h2>How has Agriculture Fared?</h2>
<p>From early in the Upton reforms the agricultural science
community felt that the new allocation processes were
discriminating against them. The FRST system of competitive bidding
still left the allocation decision to bureaucrats at the end of the
day and they would have had directions to follow (see Johnson 2000,
p 131). The net</p>

<p>result was a movement away from agricultural science
particularly because that was where the bulk of government funds
had previously been allocated. We can examine the share of total
CRI funding going to the agricultural institutes (AgRes, HORT,
Landcare and CROP) and the shares of PGSF funding in the same way.
In addition there is further evidence in a 1999 MoRST survey of
spending by `output areas?.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the share of total CRI income gained by the
agricultural institutes from 1993 to 2004. Of the total resources
commanded by the CRIs the agricultural institutes have slowly lost
out to the other institutes<sup><a class='f' href="#_ftn4" name=
"_ftnref4" title="">4</a></sup>. Each has fared differently as the
earlier discussion demonstrated. In terms of all income (Table 3)
agricultural research as a percentage of all funding has fallen
from 55 per cent to 52 per cent from 1993 to 2004, but as a
percentage of their share of PGSF grants the institutes have fallen
from 59 percent to 50 percent and as a result agr PGSF funding has
fallen from 37 per cent to 23 per cent. It is this latter trend
that AgResearch, Fonterra, Dexcel and Dairy Insight have found
disturbing.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s AgResearch was foremost in complaining that
the competitive bidding process was discriminating against
agricultural research endeavour. In 1997 MoRST instituted an
investigation of PGSF funding mechanisms and employed reviewers to
look at research fund allocations for 17 of the 19 output area
classes then being employed (<a href=
"http://www.morst.govt.nz/PGSF/evaluation">www.morst.govt.nz/PGSF/evaluation</a>s).
The reports found that research into sheep and beef production
systems and into forage and plant research were being neglected
through the imposition of other priorities on FRST. In turn, the
then funding decisions were starting to cause the breakdown of
research teams built up over the years in some research institutes
and the loss of key personnel. In response to the CRI providers,
MoRST had earlier instituted another form of funding to support CRI
staff capabilities and financial shortfalls, christened
‘non-specific output funding’ (NSOF), in 1993. In 1999-00, for
example, $26.8m was allocated to non-specific output funding. This
funding was determined as 10 per cent of the funds allocated the
previous year from the PGSF to each institute. NSOF was for public
good science and technology projects which were not subject to the
Government's priorities (NZYB 2000, p.346).</p>
<p>Table 4 shows the allocations to the four agricultural ‘output
areas’ after competitive bidding to the PGSF for the financial
years from 1993-94 to 1999-2000. The table shows that the total
PGSF fund increased by 17.6 per cent between these years and the
agricultural output areas increased by 5.3 per cent in nominal
dollars. As a result, agricultural funding decreased from 46.5 per
cent of total PGSF funding to 41.7 per cent. More marked was the
decline in the allocation to animal industries of -3.0 per cent and
the small increase in forage activities of +0.3 per cent. In real
terms, the reports say, the decline for animal industries was 14.8
per cent and for forage 11.6 per cent to 1997-98. With rising
wages, these are considerable falls in CRI incomes particularly for
AgResearch.</p>

<p>Although there were 17 output areas reviewed covering most of
the PGSF, only four of the output areas relate to agricultural
research. I present a summary of the main conclusions of the four
agricultural reviews undertaken and then a summary of the overall
review.</p>
<p><em>Output area 1: Animal industries:</em> Over the period under
review (to 1997-98), PGSF funding for Output area 1 declined in
both nominal and real terms. While overall funding for PGSF
increased, output area 1 was static, as new funds were directed to
areas perceived to be of higher priority. The majority of the
reduction appears to have resulted in a move away from sheep and
beef production research. The main providers are AgResearch,
followed by WRONZ, and MIRINZ. The report notes the commodity meat
trade now has a high value-added component. The improvement in the
value of these exports is the result of past research and
development effort. The future development of these exports is
dependent on the ability to consistently produce product to
specification, and the increasing emphasis on food safety and
quality. These attributes will increase the requirement for
appropriate research at all stages in the supply chain including
production research. The main commercial funding for the set of
providers comes from the producers boards and could be considered
at risk. The science reforms have encouraged collaboration between
researchers including applications to FRST. However, the extensive
nature of the industry, and the presence of some commodity trade
biases ‘makes it difficult for researchers to obtain appropriate
direction for research’ (ibid). Farmers as a group were well aware
of the benefits of PGSF funding.</p>
<p><em>Output area 2: Dairy:</em> In the dairy report, it is noted
that funding has grown strongly over the previous 5 years - 69 per
cent in nominal terms and 51 per cent in real terms. The share of
the PGSF fund rose from 3.1 per cent to 4.7 per cent. The report
noted that there was growth in the number of programmes supported
and growth in the size of programmes. Research output was dominated
by 3 providers: AgResearch, DRC and DRI. The providers derive
considerable funds from outside the PGSF system. The over-all level
of funding is considerably less than in output areas 1 and 3 which
is surprising considering the size of the dairy industry. However,
many of the programmes are generic to both animal and dairy outputs
and thus support the dairy industry too. There is a high level of
collaboration between AgRes and DRC. In a survey there was a high
level of awareness of PGSF advantages among end-users. ‘Vertical
integration in the industry ensures research strategies are closely
linked to commercial strategies. The report concludes that output
area 2 is the only agriculturally focused output to attract a
significant increase in funding level over the past five
years’.</p>
<p><em>Output area 3: Forage:</em> Total funding declined by 1.9
per cent in nominal terms and 11.6 per cent in real terms to
1997-98. ‘This decline is a cause for concern’. The report notes
that forage production is the base that provides the competitive
advantage for the single largest contributor to the NZ economy -
the agricultural sector. The principal provider is AgResearch. A
high level of collaboration was observed both internationally and
within NZ. There was also a high level of awareness among end-users
of the aims of the PGSF. ‘Industry end-users included in the forage
sector are two and a half times more likely to be involved in the
licensing or commercialisation of products generated by PGSF
research compared with other agricultural sectors’ (ibid). Overall
output funding declined from 8.5 per cent of PGSF funding to 7.3
per cent. The report says: ‘the scientific capacity for forage
research is under threat as the real level of funding has decreased
over the five years’.</p>
<p><em>Output area 4: Horticulture:</em> The full title of this
report is <em>Horticulture, Arable and other Food and Beverage
Industries.</em> The report notes that industry funding increased
slightly over the 5 year period although there was a decrease
immediately after 1993/94. A number of smaller fruit, crop,
ornamentals, vegetables and the arable groups increased their
private funding contributions. Government investment has been held
at $51m. There was a range of collaborative networking and
subcontracting. The main providers were HortResearch (56 per cent)
and Crop and Food (35 per cent). There was evidence of ‘strong’
involvement in PGSF research and also ‘strong’ evidence of capacity
for accessing international research. The report notes that ‘PGSF
funding has made a ‘strong’ contribution to economic outcomes’. The
size of individual programmes appeared to be decreasing. Total
funding increased by 1.3 per cent in nominal terms but decreased by
approximately 15 per cent in real terms. The share of PGSF funding
dropped from 19.8 per cent to 17.6 per cent. ‘Prior to 1995, FRST
policy was to direct funds away from research that was appropriable
and this policy affected this output area. Since 1995, a change in
instructions required greater account to be taken of the relevance
of research and involvement of users. The industry has responded’
(ibid).</p>
<p>The above reviews of output areas in the agricultural research
sector shows that national priorities moved away from production
research both on the plant and the animal area. FRST was under
instruction from MoRST at all times so that is where primary
responsibility lay! The reasons for the decline in meat and wool
production and forage research investment appear to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a common belief that agriculture is an ‘old industry’ and
support should be going to ‘new’ industries;</li>
<li>the move from production output areas to infrastructure areas
;</li>
<li>constraints on funding available;</li>
<li>the movement away from public funding of providers of
appropriable research;</li>
<li>a shift away from output areas where PGSF was ‘too
dominant’:</li>
<li>an increase in ‘complementary’ funding to the private
sector;</li>
<li>the ‘crowding out’ belief held in some circles; and</li>
<li>the possible over-application of ‘market failure’
theory<sup><a class='f' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=
"">5</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The New Paradigm - Dairy 21</h2>
<p>In the meantime, the agricultural research interests were not
sitting quietly. One key development has been the development of a
‘Strategic Framework for Dairy Farming´s Future’ and the formation
of Dairy 21. The purpose of the framework is to ‘set the strategic
direction for all on-farm research, development, extension and
education’. Funding to achieve the targets and objectives ‘will
come from a number of sources: government, industry good, Agmardt,
provider investment, industry and agribusiness’. The major dairy
cooperative, Fonterra, can be seen as the driver behind this
initiative as part of its quest to achieve industry growth and
productivity goals.</p>
<p>The first version of the strategy document was adopted jointly
by the Boards of Dairy Insight and Dexcel in 2004 and then endorsed
by the wider industry. A second version, commissioned by Dairy 21
(a peak industry body with membership from Fonterra, Livestock
Improvement, Dairy Companies Association, Dexcel and AgResearch)
has been drafted after feedback and consultation.</p>
<p>The industry has set a goal of boosting farm productivity by 4
per cent per year. Dairy 21 has already <u>lobbied Government for a
$60m boost to pastoral farming research</u>. The Chairman of
Fonterra states that putting resources into ‘core’ agriculture is a
safer bet than some less-established sectors, and that the above
sum is a relatively small amount of money given the potential
economic benefits to the country (<em>The Dominion Post</em>,
28.9.05).</p>
<p>Fonterra was clearly showing considerable leadership in getting
the pastoral research participants together. According to the
<em>National Business Review</em> (16.12.05), Fonterra has been
pushing its own research agenda vigorously since cutting its $159m
funding package to biotec subsidiary ViaLactia, in a major
restructure in 2004. The CEO stated that the company wanted a more
efficient model that makes sense for all parties involved. It
wanted to avoid as much duplication in the farming sector as
possible and to ensure the company was not burdened with spending
money on research that does not directly benefit its value-added
goals. Fonterra is said to have initiated the Dairy 21 project.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, AgResearch was in the news on the
1<sup>st</sup> of November 2005. The CEO announced that AgResearch
needed $73 m for buildings alone. Dr West argued <u>that the extra
$60m should go straight to the Crown research institutes</u> who
will then decide what to spend it on. He also argued that farmers´
contributions to research investment should rise too. ‘The $10m
they contribute in levies is not much when you consider farm gate
returns are $6 billion’. AgResearch´s strategic plan for the next
15 years was based on the country investing in its core strengths,
the husbandry of plants and animals, he said. He outlined that
major investments were required in an animal health laboratory in
Palmerston North, a new animal animal handling facility at
Grasslands, a biosecurity and infectious diseases facility near
Wellington, a centre for reproduction and genomics in Dunedin and
other new buildings. Dr West said it was an article of faith that
more funding would come.</p>
<p>Taken with Government showing a willingness to increase devolved
funding to the CRIs [though the increase in the 2005-06 Budget is
quite small] there is apparently a marked willingness in the
agricultural research sector to expand their research activities.
The agricultural research lobby has increased its mass and
firepower and has started to put significant research programs in
front of government for public good spending. Private participation
will be needed as well. It appears unlikely Government will come to
the party in a big way given other pressures on government
expenditure. While the Minister talks of investing 3 per cent of
GDP (a trebling) in future years, marked increases in research
spending by the government or the private sector are not likely to
be of that order.</p>
<h2>The Future of Competitive Bidding</h2>
<p>MoRST have, since 1999, been feeling their way toward more
devolution in decision making. The latest manifestation is the
<em>Picking up the Pace</em> document (MoRST 2005). A portfolio
approach to applications to group them together is endorsed, and
larger projects and longer terms of contract are to be considered
by FRST in allocating research funds. At last report, FRST had
delayed the beginning of the 2006 round of bidding while new
directions for providers are worked out.</p>
<p>Discussions between the Government and the research industry
have evolved toward a new approach to the bidding system. The aim
appears to be a move away from short term contestable funding and a
move toward long term commitment of resources to individual
providers to plan their own priorities. I would interpret this as a
return to the priority setting process under the DSIR and MAF where
priorities were internalised within departments with the surety
that the Minister of Finance would always provide the committed
funds in following years. Duplication and crowding out were not
then seen as a problem.</p>
<p>Before the Budget in May 2005, there was newspaper discussion of
the replacement of non-specific output funding (NSOF) by a
capability fund (<em>Dominion Post</em> 11.5.05). The article noted
that NSOF had been paid out to help meet operating costs, pay for
non-funded research and retain staff. CRIs had complained that
2004-05 funding of NSOF of $32.376m was inadequate to retain
promising scientists, but funding agencies were concerned that
providing money without specifying how it should be used made
accountability difficult. A CRI scientist was quoted as saying ‘the
key issue is uncertainty. Once you put in a funding application you
don?t know for nine months whether or not you are going to be
successful. That makes it difficult to plan ahead’.</p>
<p>Minister Maharey then made a major announcement at the beginning
of July 2005. He said that it is <u>now time for less
contestability and more annual ‘devolved allocations’ to CRIs</u>.
The methods of allocation were still being developed, he stated. He
noted that research institutes needed sustainable funding to be
able to maintain core competencies, finance capital works, and new
equipment and address the loss of researchers and inability to
recruit young scientists. ‘Contestability is not completely the
wrong answer, because it drives innovation, but it went to
extremes’. He further noted that previously the aim of science
policy under successive governments had been <u>to reduce funding
of research of benefit to industry from the public purse</u>,
requiring industries and producers to contribute directly to
appropriate Crown research institute research programmes. He also
indicated it was time CRI boards were given more of the
discretionary roles they were set up for, <u>instead of the funding
bodies making all the key decisions</u>.</p>
<p>In the 2005 statement of intent, <em>Sustaining Strong
Investment: Excellence in Knowledge and Innovation
(www.morst.govt.nz),</em> the Minister (Mr Maharey) announced that
the government would continue to sustain strong investment in
RS&amp;T, particularly on people and resources. The new Capability
Fund will <u>replace</u> the former Non-Science Outputs Fund
(NSOF), to assist the CRIs to maintain core capabilities.</p>
<p>In the <em>Picking up the Pace,</em> government confirmed that
it had moved away from the competitive bidding model for Research and Development
funding toward more long term arrangements with the science
providers. It said <u>they needed to step up from simplistic public
choice theory models of the 1990s!</u>. The needs of the industry
were: long-term sustainable investment; a stable funding
environment; support for high performers; a clear and purposeful
Research and Development agenda; enhanced opportunities for collaboration,
networking and technology transfer. One of the early indications of
the approach is FRST´s Outcome Based Investments (OBIs) which are
focused on research sectors where the contracted research delivers
benefits that are widely dispersed and not solely of value to a
single individual or organization.</p>
<p>The government intention is stated to be investment that will
keep pace with increasing research costs, innovative opportunities
and OECD trends, and <u>accompanied by matching growth in the
private sector</u>. They proposed development of a multi-year
RS&amp;T budget package: accelerated growth of Research and Development investment
by private companies through leveraging public sector investment
and applying other incentives; greater trust in research
organisations to make decisions where they have an information
advantage and can maximise the advantage of a devolved investment
approach; devolve up to 60 per cent of PGSF to research
organisations; ensure non- devoted funds (Health, NERF, Marsden and
Technology NZ) provide regular opportunities for new ideas to be
funded; to define what a successful CRI looks like; and to develop
measures for financial and non-financial performance.</p>
<p>This shift in thinking is reflected in FRST?s statement of
intent dated April 2005 (FRST 2005a). ‘To support the Government´s
strategies and address the Minister´s challenges FRST´s strategy
focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li>investing in areas that will help achieve <u>measurable target
outcomes</u> where RS&amp;T can make a real difference in improving
wealth and wellbeing;</li>
<li>investing in a manner that encourages improved performance in
achieving these outcomes <u>including greater devolution of
decision making</u> to RS&amp;T providers;</li>
<li>evaluating and bench marking performance to support making the
right investment choices to reinforce and <u>reward good
performance</u>; and</li>
<li>enhancing the Foundation´s role as facilitator of an integrated
and responsive innovation system’.</li>
</ul>
<p>FRST people have said that the Foundation is currently assisting
MoRST as they work through the policy development process. ‘Over
the last couple of years we have been trying various ways to
provide <u>longer and larger investments</u> while still ensuring
that emerging research and researchers are able to succeed with
proposals for investment. We have been working to identify
practical implementation issues, identification of which is
essential to achieve the improvements we are all looking for‘
(N.Allison, FRST, pers com, October 2005).</p>
<p>In a document about investment signals and requests for
proposals on the website (FRST 2005b), the Foundation outlines how
it will handle investment proposals for the round starting in July
2007. FRST notes that the Minister wishes to bring greater
stability into the funding environment. This will involve
<u>reducing contestability</u> in the system by <u>devolving
funding</u> and detailed decision making to research organisations
although <u>some portfolios funds will be released for investment
through fully contestable project rounds</u>. FRST has received
consistent feedback and support on the need for New Zealand to use
its limited RS&amp;T investment in a more focused manner where that
is possible. FRST interprets this as investment <u>that is narrower
and deeper.</u></p>
<p>In his 2006 Budget statement (<a href=
"http://www.beehive.govt.nz/">www.beehive.govt.nz</a>), Mr Maharey
reinforced the message concerning greater certainty for longer term
research. ‘Talks will be held with the science sector about how we
can take these changes forward’. ‘While contestability continues to
be an important part of our science system too much contestability
can affect the ability of our scientists and our science
organisations to carry out research and apply their ideas over a
longer period’. He mentioned negotiated investments for longer term
programmes, systematic review of science programmes, steps to
reduce costs and complexity, more certainty of funding for
essential ‘backbone’ infra structure, and continuing to increase
the capability of New Zealand´s Crown Research Institutes.</p>
<p>On 6<sup>th</sup> May 2006, the Minister sent a directive to
FRST instructing them to give effect to government policy to
improve the effectiveness and stability of the funding environment
(FRST 2006). This states there is a need to progressively implement
better negotiated funding for eligible programmes within Vote R,S
and T. That to be considered for negotiated re-investment, a
research programme will have to be of sufficient size and have
received funding for at least six years, and from two successive
bidding rounds. Eligible programmes will then need to satisfy
quality and relevance criteria that include, but are not limited
to, a combination of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>scientific and technical quality, including track record of
delivering benefit to New Zealand, and future potential to deliver
benefit to New Zealand;</li>
<li>long-term comparative advantage in an area of direct benefit to
NZ, or unique significance to NZ;</li>
<li>alignment with relevant end-user and government
strategies;</li>
<li>evidence of end-user support and industry co-funding; and</li>
<li>a track record of the research organisations´ accountability
for public money.</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>As a result of this Direction, FRST issued a Consultation
Document called “New Investment Pathways and Processes”. The
emphasis in the consultative document is how would FRST
administrative processes work in the future within the constraints
of a relatively fixed Budget allocation and existing commitments to
providers? As from the 2006-07 funding round, only a limited number
of provider?s programmes would qualify to be re-negotiated. It
would take some time to move to more negotaiated funding and less
competitive bidding.</p>
<p>Very soon it became evident that the new funding proposals were
not going well within organisations outside the CRI network. A
riposte came from Otago University (<em>Dominion Post,</em>
31.5.06) following a meeting with FRST?s chief science advisor.
Their objection over longer term contracts was that major funding
would only go those already holding large contracts - mainly the
CRIs - with essentially no questions asked. This would put
University applicants for new funding ‘playing with pocket money’.
They objected to new administrative rules set out in a consultation
document: (a) that negotiation will be only over renewal of
existing long-term contracts worth more than $1m per year, and (b)
that severe restrictions remained on the size and number of bids
for new contracts. The professors ended by suggesting the Crown
Research Institutes simply be made to face a performance based
research fund the same as the universities have! Not to mention
continued access to all FRST funds.</p>
<p>My take on all this is that the devil is in the detail. The
professors spotted a flaw, from their point of view, in the
contestable fund´s administrative proposals. It seems to me that as
long as science is organised on a <u>public funding</u> basis, and
proposals have to be assessed <u>project by project</u>, and
<u>outcomes are uncertain</u> and well in the future, then we have
to have administrated science funding. This is no different from
what DSIR and MAF did in the palmy old days when they internalised
the proceess and were guided by very light supervision from NRAC.
Someone like Tim Hazeldine should sit down and examine which system
had the highest and lowest transaction costs.</p>

<p>Notes: The CRIs vary in their treatment of individual items of
revenue. AgResearch is perhaps the fullest treatment. They include
(besides FRST and MoRST) other CRIs, Govt depts, commercial
arrangements, royalties, produce, dividends, and interest (others
may include sale of assets). Due to these measurement errors the
procedure was adopted of deducting PGSF/MoRST derived revenue from
total revenue to create an entity `Non-PGSF' revenue to represent
trends in the privatisation of public research. The last row shows
the percentage increase in non-PGSF revenue from 1993 to 2004 for
each CRI.</p>

have recently published a revised set of tables back to 1994 which
corrects the earlier survey data to the same basis as the later
surveys carried out by Statistics New Zealand. Total investment and
provider shares therefore now vary slightly from the data in
earlier years.</p>

have recently circulated a think-piece by P Morten on becoming more
globally competitive. The paper returns to the export encouragement
model of earlier years and ends up with a strong argument for more
investment in agricultural Research and Development. Johnson (1999) is a a fairly
recent presentation of the export led growth argument.</p>
