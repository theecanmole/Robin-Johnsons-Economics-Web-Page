<h1>Transport costs would blow out our &lsquo;food miles&rsquo;</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="by">By J Pryde and R Johnson</p>

<p>Recent discussions of &lsquo;food miles&rsquo; and
recent news from Tesco on environmental labelling suggest that overseas
consumers are getting more and more sensitive about the environmental foot
print of New Zealand export products. There is a considerable body of thought
that the environmental or social costs of food products should be taken into
account in setting so-called social prices that these products would sell for.
This could be achieved by sanctions on their use or by carbon type taxes on
international trade. If this comes about, New Zealand trade in agricultural
products could be seriously affected.</p>

<p>Environmental footprints, as they are
called, reflect the energy consumed in production and transport. Using up
energy contributes to the accumulation of  certain gases in the earth’s
atmosphere from man's production activities including international transport
systems. From a climate change point of view the accumulation of these gases is
a social bad which should be curbed  if the environment is to be protected. If
accumulation of these gases is bad, it is but one step to stating that trade in
goods should be subject to an environmental social cost assessment to ascertain
the real &lsquo;cost&rsquo; to consumers. From that step it is but another step to imposing
sanctions or carbon taxes on New Zealand exports!</p>

<p>Recent discussion of &lsquo;food miles&rsquo; is an
example of this kind of social cost assessment. &lsquo;Food miles&rsquo; are a measure of the
energy used  and carbon and other greenhouse gases emitted from transport to
consumer destinations. Such assessment would particularly affect New Zealand
producers of primary products sold overseas as this country has one of the
greatest distances to cover to bring its exports to market. However, with our
natural advantages in production systems, it has been shown by the Lincoln
University study that most of our primary products have fewer &lsquo;food miles&rsquo;
incorporated in them than the comparable products produced in Europe.</p>

<p>It is worrisome to New Zealand that influential people in the United Kingdom, like the Stern report and <i>The
Guardian</i> have embraced the notion of &lsquo;food miles&rsquo;. The Lincoln report has
fortunately allayed fears that New Zealand products have an unduly high
environmental footprint even when &lsquo;food miles&rsquo; are taken into account.</p>

<p>Sanctions on New Zealand exports in the
name of environmentalism would have to be imposed by our dominant customers off
shore. It seems to us that there would have to be concerted action possibly
through multilateral agencies like the World Trade Organisation to bring this
about and such multilateral action would affect other distant producers as well
as New Zealand.</p>

<p>In addition, there was scope in the GATT
and in more recent agreements under the Uruguay Round for countries to
introduce restrictionist measures in the environmental area  if thought
justified for good domestic reasons. Article XX stated that no country could be
prevented from taking measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or
plant life and health, or the environment, provided the measures did not 
constitute an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries. This
provision has stood New Zealand well in the area of  quarantine and health
certification.</p>

<p>There is thus a broad possibility that our
customers, unilaterally or multilaterally, could in time proceed to impose
carbon taxes or other sanctions on New Zealand exports. If such sanctions have
a transport component then New Zealand is likely to be one of the countries
most affected by their imposition if they come about.</p>
<p>New Zealand thus has a vested interest in
avoiding unilateral or multilateral imposition of taxes on carbon emissions
whether in the productive process or in the transport system we use. Therefore
we are probably right to reject the concept of &lsquo;food miles&rsquo; as these would
certainly lie behind any system introduced to try and even up the social costs
of imported and domestic primary products. On the wider front, New Zealand
would have to be careful not to exacerbate matters  by ill-prepared taxes and
sanctions on our own export industries. We should seek other methods to contain
global warming and avoid jeopardising the very export base on which our
standard of living depends. As the Stern report shows, there is a build-up of
analyses and policy propositions going on overseas that could see some
international political action to reduce climate change emissions whether we
like it or not.</p>
