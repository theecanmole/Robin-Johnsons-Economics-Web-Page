The reason: low fertility among cows, a low calving rate, high mortality among young calves, and sufficient sales of the reserve and slaughterings within the reserve. With regard to converting the African owned cattl herds in the Reserves to weaner production are mentioned as obstacles: maintaining an adequate supply of work animals, and their replacements; the rate of natural increase would have to be stepped up by suitable changes in the herd structure at the present rate of slaughter and deaths. Improvement of the husbandry programme, with breed control, selection, winter feeding would reduce calf mortality and raise the calving percentage. Control of stock numbers would be necessary. !--></li><p></p>

<!--This study, which also appeared as "Technical Paper in Agricultural Economics no. 5 of the Department of Economics, U.C.R.N.", deals with a special experiment in rural development - not to be confined with the normal Development Plan of the Northern Rhodesia Government - made possible by a loan of L2. million to the Government by the Rhodesian Selection Trust group of mining companies. The Northern province of Northern Rhodesia was chosen for the experiment partly because it seemed to lack agricultural potential and partly it had felt the full effects of selective migration to the mines since copper mining started to expand rapidly in the early thirties. The Scheme was an attempt to tackle the problems of such an area at two rather different levels: 1. To improve the amenities in the province to make them somewhat more comparable with those available in the mining towns? 2. To foster development projects in transport and primary industry. The 1st chapter of thisreport gives the broad picture of both these objectives, while the remainder is concerned purely with the attempt to foster agricultural development in the Kasama area!--></li><p></p>

The purpose of the survey was to collect as much information as possible about the economic aspects of tribal life over the agricultural year. Records were therefore kept of land use, crop labour requirements, labour immigration and income and expenditure, for the period from October I960 to September 1961. Some 120 families in five villages were regularly visited throughout this period to make these records. Six research assistants actually carried out the recording, visiting their respective families on bicycles several times a week.

<!--(Paper copy held) Abstract The author shows that an additional unit of labour input for some crops earns a reward greater than zero. The discussion of disguised unemployment in the village economy has not produced strong evidence of zero marginal returns in subsistence agriculture. There is good evidence of seasonal unemployment in the village, but it is also apparent that many villagers in. more accessible areas at least have taken the opportunity to add to their real earnings by taking dry-season employment. Reducing disguised unemployment is less of a problem in Rhodesia and Zambia, and far more attention should be paid to overcoming fluctuations in the level of employment and to the nature of open unemployment which is found in many of the main towns.!---></li><p></p>

<!--  Keywords C2 urban fringe: land use and policy Abstract New Zealand has a history of conflict over land use at the urban periphery. The institutional arrangements for resolution are incorporated in the Town and Country Planning Act. Urban and peri-urban expansion were very active in the 1960's and early 1970's and many cases were brought before the Planning Tribunal, provided under the Act, for judicial resolution. Principal points of conflict were sizes of holding permitted in subdivisions and permissions for the erection of dwellings in areas zoned for rural use.
More recent experience has seen a decline in urban expansion. This appears to be related to lower population growth, static levels of real income, changes in tastes with regard to rural living and changes in transport costs and habits.

 <!--The views presented are those of the author alone and are offered as a contribution to the discussion topic set down. Abstract: This paper examines changes in agricultural policy goals and identifies appropriate responses from the extension industry in New Zealand. For many years long-term policy goals for economic growth centered on the dominant role of agricultural products in merchandise exports. Growth of export income implied encouragement of growth in agricultural production and exports. This focus provided a leading goal for the extension movement in the period under review. In 1984, changes in the exchange rate regime removed the need for a direct export encouragement stance. Export industries, including agriculture, should have the same treatment as any other industry. The response of the extension movement to this change must be to identify new goals for its programmes and mission. It is suggested that goals of productivity and efficiency should be substituted for the traditional goal of export growth and that effort should be concentrated on identifying the problems of producers in the new economic environment. It is submitted that, in this environment, all the stages of production from farm to final market, are of equal importance in improving efficiency, and that it might now be appropriate to include these stages in any new mission statement for the extension movement.
New Zealand agriculture. New Zealand agriculture is dominated by the pastoral industries based on sheep and cattle. Reasonably adequate rainfall ensures almost year round supplies of grass and reduces the need for supplementary feeding. Improved ryegrass, white clover pasture is dependent on regular supplies of phosphatic fertiliser, most of which has to be imported. In contrast to Australia, beef and sheep production tends to be carried out on the same property, while dairy production is normally found in smaller!--></li><p></p>

These include the Capital Asset pricing Model (CAPM), option Price Theory, Arbitrage pricing Theory (APT) , and optimal Capital Structure Theory. This paper reviews risk management options for individual farm firms from this point of view and suggests possible strategic constructs for individual proprietors to follow. The paper analyses the components of business and financial risk; the weighted average cost of capital; discount rates and capitalisation rates and the return to equity; the reduction of risk through diversification; the influence of tax shields; and the use of option pricing to measure the premium attached to a given reduction in risk. Arbitrage pricing is discussed as a special case of CAPM which provides an alternative and improved assessment of systematic risk.!--></li><p></p>

<!-- ABSTRACT In its heyday project evaluation was based on single valued estimates of input and output parameters that gave the technique a precision it never had. Since a project represents an investment in the ~ it is subject to estimation uncertainty as with any other budget type forecast. It is debatable whether this uncertainty should be reflected in the discount rate or the input and output parameters or both. Furthermore, many projects change the risk status of a given outcome without explicit recognition in the typical output parameters presented to decision makers. This paper discusses procedures which could make these concerns more explicit, including CAPM, analytical risk analysis and option pricing. --></p><p>

<!-- ABSTRACT The 1947 GATT Agreement recognised that sanitary and phytosanitary measures were permissible exceptions to the Agreement where plant. animal and human life issues were at stake. The Agreement also similarly made exception for measures relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources. Signatories to the Tokyo Round Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade agreed to notify the GATT Secretariat of technical regulations for products that differed from international standards where they existed. In recent years the balance of these notifications has changed from public health and safety issues to protection of the environmental issues. This paper discusses economic and trade problems which arise. --></li><p></p>

Recent literature emphasises collective decision making as a bargaining process with the results depending on the respective power bases of the participants and the game strategies each might follow. The political power approach involves quantifying the relative political power of each party. These approaches need to be examined against the role of political institutions and constitutions in collective decision making. Adherents to these views claim that collective decision making is an inherently complex process that involves threats and counter-threats, compromises, coalitions, levels of disagreement and path dependence. This paper surveys these writings and suggests some applications to Westminster political systems and further research. Key words: policy formation, public choice, political economy, collective decision making. --></li><p></p>
