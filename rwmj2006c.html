<h1>Investment in private R &amp; D before 1989: use of
proxies</h1>
<h4>Is it better to travel hopefully than arrive
satisfactorily?</h4>
<p class="by">By Robin Johnson<a href="#_ftn1" class='f' name=
"_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><em>Recent analyses of private investment in R &amp; D in NZ,
such as that of Weshah Razzak and Julia Hall, have utilised some
rough data approximations for the period from 1960 to 1990 before
the MoRST survey came into effect. On the public investment side,
there are more adequate records of government departmental
expenditures and grants going back to the 1960s. This paper reports
on a suggestion (made originally by Ralph Lattimore) that the
expenditure on R &amp; D by para-statals like the marketing boards
would offer some guidance. The relevance of this is that the MoRST
survey classifies marketing boards as part of the private sector
and not the public sector. Business investment cannot be retrieved
retrospectively, unfortunately. The boards supported a series of
research institutes (like DRI, MIRINZ, and WRONZ) who were
ostensibly part of the processing sector but which also did R &amp;

D for primary producers. These institutes also received government
grants through the DSIR. In the event, only 3 institutes - WRONZ,
DRI and LASRA<a href="#_ftn2" class='f' name="_ftnref2" title=
"">(2)</a> - could provide records of research expenditure back to
1960. Hence the title of this paper - the proposal is that the
combined expenditure of three of the institutes could provide a
proxy for not only all the other institutes but also that of the
business sector! This series was then adjusted to the 1989
determinations of MoRST to create a new series of private
investment in NZ R &amp; D. This paper discusses these techniques
and compares the resulting data with earlier results determined by
the author (Johnson 1999).</em></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There have been several recent studies of the role of R &amp; D
investment in the economy (Johnson 1999, Johnson 2000a, Johnson,
Razzak and Stillman 2006, Hall and Scobie 2006). These studies are
dependent on the research data available on business and government
expenditure on R &amp; D. Hall and Scobie employ original estimates
for the agricultural sector back to 1927. Private investment is
proxied by utilising an indicator of government (DSIR) grants to
the sector. Since 1989, MoRST (and latterly Statistics New Zealand)
have conducted a bi-annual survey of firms and organisations to
determine annual spending in the private sector, in the government
sector, and in the universities. Before 1989 there are fairly good
records on government expenditure but very little on the business
sector and the universities.</p>
<p>The data sets used by the various authors are dependent on the
MoRST (1999 and others) survey and government records available
before 1989. For Johnson and Razzak studies, a series of private
sector estimates determined by Johnson (1999) are employed. For the
universities this involved taking a varying proportion of the
annual grant to the universities from government for the years
before 1989 and interpolating this data with the MoRST data. For
the private sector, the ratio of 1989 private expenditure to GDP
was extrapolated back to 1960 in line with government expenditure
(Table A1 below). The business sector was renamed the private
sector, and government and the universities were combined to define
the public sector. Hall and Scobie build on the Scobie and
Eveleens' paper (1986), and derive agricultural private R &amp; D
expenditure from the DSIR grants to the research associations.</p>

My hypothesis is that the private investment record before 1990
would be more acceptable if it were derived from original data of
some sort than derived from some varying proportion of GDP. Talking
to Ralph Lattimore in August 2005 I realised that some records
could survive from the industry research associations which make up
an important proportion of the MoRST definition of 'business' R
&amp; D. (For some reason, MoRST classified the industry research
associations as 'business' and the CRIs as 'government' while
Government heavily subsidised them both). To this end, I contacted
six of the remaining industry institutes for their records of
research expenditure but was only able to locate records for three
- DRI, Leather and WRONZ. The remaining three were MIRINZ, Cawthron
and the Fertiliser Association. As a fallback from this line of
enquiry I re-investigate the kinds of grants and subsidies
available for private sector R &amp; D in the 1960s, 1970s and
1980s.
<p>In this paper, I set out the new estimates of private R &amp; D
expenditure, their relation to what I prepared in 1999 (Tables A2,
A3, and A4), and some new estimates of the research stock
elasticities with respect to total factor productivity (TFP),
followed by a section of the research grants given to private
entities. The results for the research associations are generally
disappointing but they do suggest further interpretations of the R
&amp; D history of NZ are possible and future workers could build
on them. The results for the analysis based on government grants
are more promising and suggest further areas of work.</p>
<h2>Building a New Data Set</h2>
<p>With the cooperation of the research associations, I collected
the annual R &amp; D current expenditure in financial years in
current dollars for the three organisations for the period
1962-1990. This is what they actually spent and does not include
capital expenditure. Some of it would have been funded by
government subsidy especially in the 1960s and 1970s. I then
estimated a national total of private expenditure on the assumption
that each year's national figure was proportional to that of the
three institutes and joining the MoRST figure for 1989-90 (Table
A4). The results show that expenditure was somewhat lower in the
1960s and 1970s with a period of rapid catch up in the 1980s as
compared with the previous estimate.<a href="#_ftn3" class='f'
name="_ftnref3" title="">(3)</a> I then computed a new set of
stocks of private knowledge and combined these with the existing
estimates of public stocks. The stock transformation is shown at
the foot of Table A3.</p>

<p>In Johnson (1999) these estimates of R &amp; D stocks were
tested in a TFP framework on the assumption that the effects of
previous R &amp; D expenditure would be brought out in the Solow
residual rather than directly on industry net output. In addition,
foreign spillovers were incorporated in the form of Australian R
&amp; D expenditure and government education expenditure in NZ and
these were explored as a measure of human skills and other factors
outside the R &amp; D effects on Solow productivity. The TFP
measure was derived from the Philpott data set and capital and
labour were weighted by fixed weights based the average shares of
income for the period concerned. The estimation equation looked
like this:</p>
<p>(1) <em>TFP<sub>it</sub> = Const +B<sub>1</sub>PVTR &amp;

DS<sub>it-1</sub> + B<sub>2</sub>PUBR &amp; DS <sub>it-1</sub> +
B<sub>3</sub>AUSR &amp; DS<sub>t-1</sub>

+B<sub>4</sub>EDU<sub>t-1</sub></em></p>
<p>where the i's refer to industry categories in the old NZSIC SNA
system and <i>S</i> shows that the stock of research knowledge is
being tested. Education expenditure does not enter as a stock.</p>
<p>Due to the incompleteness of the Yearbook records of Government
expenditure on R &amp; D before 1990, Philpott's 21 industry
categories were summarised into 9 categories: Agriculture, Fishing
, Forestry, Primary Processing, Manufacturing, Building and
Construction, Transport and Storage, Energy and Services. The
aggregate data was for the Market Economy (MK) that is, TFP was
estimated for all the then NZSIC categories <u>excluding</u>
Ownership of Dwellings and the Government sector.</p>

<p>In the case of industry equations in the form of (1), separate
categories of R &amp; D stocks were identified previously and
tested (see Table A5). As this methodology was also very
approximate, we now test some alternatives to this procedure as
well. We use the agriculture sector as an example in this
paper.</p>
<p>There is a fairly complete record, compiled by NRAC, of the
grants paid out by government departments to various entities for R
&amp; D activities. I assume that this was largely paid to the
private sector though cross-departmental grants cannot be ruled
out. I propose to re-examine this data, available from 1964-65
fiscal year to 1985-86. From 1985-86 to 1989-90 I extrapolated this
series in proportion to DSIR grants (Table A6).</p>
<h5>Comparisions and Tests: The Market Sector</h5>
<p>Table 1 shows the results for the re-estimation of equation (1)
for the market sector as defined by Philpott (1994). The tabulation
shows the successive estimates made as the data was assembled and
refined up to the present time. The results given in the 1999
conference paper were modified in the same year as a mistake was
made in the lag system and were published in Johnson (2000b).
Successive re-estimations show the effect of:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>(a) the new data for private expenditure from
the research association for the same period as previously,<br />
(b) the effect of extending the 1999 R &amp; D data up to
2002,<br />

(c) the effect of extending the new data for private expenditure up
to 2002, and<br />
(d) the effect of using the government grant series.</p>
<p>The broad pattern emerges that accumulated stocks of private R
&amp; D knowledge are consistently related to the following year's
Solow residual. The accumulated stocks of public R &amp; D are
negatively related to the following year's TFP. There are
reasonably consistent relationships between TFP and Australian R
&amp; D stocks, but somewhat negative relationships with the level
of vote education. This may be because EDU is a poor indicator of
skill levels or changes in the Solow residual are driven from
elsewhere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new data from the research associations contributes nothing
in the period 1962-98 but resurfaces over the longer period
1962-2002. In the period 1962-98, public stocks of R &amp; D are
now non-sgnificant but also re-emerge in 1962-02. The Cobb Douglas
model confirms the earlier results for 1962-98 for private and
public stocks of R &amp; D knowledge. The rates of return on
depreciated capital invested in private and public R &amp; D vary
from $11.9 to $17 per $ invested in the private case and $-4.8 to
$-7 in the public case (Johnson 2000b, pp.10-19). The grants model
(7) is an improvement on result (5) when the RA ivestment variable
is replaced by a grant variable (Table A6). In this specification
there is also a significant association with Australian R &amp; D
investment and a negative relationship to Education spending. For
the period 1965-98 the grants model also works well.as compared
with (3)</p>
<p>The new data on private investment in R &amp; D by RAs is
disappointing. The private investment series based on proportions
of national income used from 1999 onwards was possibly picking up
systematic fluctuations in national income. This then became
reflected in the stock of R &amp; D in a given year. Since the
dependent variable, TFP, was set as a function of that stock in the
previous year, a very positive relationship emerged. The actual
expenditure by the research associations appears to be independent
of changes in GDP. It is possible that government grants change as
Budget policy changes which could be associated with changes in
GDP.</p>

<h5>Comparisions and Tests: the Agriculture Sector</h5>
<p>The next section is devoted to the way I treated individual
sectors of the economy in the 1999 analysis. The Johnson <em>et
al</em> (2006) paper and the Hall and Scobie paper also used the
same data base. It will be recalled that historic data
availabilities restricted the analyis to 9 sectors, viz,
Agriculture, Fishing, Forestry, Primary Processing, Manufacturing,
Energy, Building, Transport, and Services. For the R &amp; D data
set, categories were matched by groupings of 'output areas'
according to the then MoRST definitions. In the case of private
investment in R &amp; D the MoRST data only ran from the 1989-90
fiscal year. For the period 1962-90 the sector shares were based on
the MoRST 1990 survey (Table A5). (In addition, after the
publication of the 1999 results, the sector shares were revised to
take in the university shares).</p>
<p>The analysis will proceed in steps in the following order:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>(a) the effect of the revised 1999 share
allocation 1962-98<br />
(b) the effect of the new definition of PVT 1962-98<br />

(c) the effect of updating the data series to 2002<br />
(d) the effect of spillovers in R &amp; D, and,<br />
(e) the effect of the grants variable.</p>
<p>The question of spillovers arises because each industry sector
obtains new knowledge from the total body of previous research
carried out. It may be that in a statistical snse that a given
industry group may show a greater sympathy with national trends
than with its own sector trends. In addition, the concept of `own?
research for an industry is very hazy and in the MoRST surveys is
nominated by the providers. There is more discussion of this
problem in the Summary and Conclusions section.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows the effects on the agriculture sector of the
revised share allocations between industries shown in Table A5. The
1999 estimation gave a very strong indication of positive
relationships. The 1999 revision likewise. When the university
shares were introduced, the elasticities were smaller for PVT and
PUB but stayed the same sign and significance.</p>

<p>Table 5 shows some results testing the spillover hypothesis. In
1. we test whether <u>national</u> PVT R &amp; D stocks would offer
a better explanation of changes in agriculture TFP in place of the
supposed agriculture share. The elasticity is greater than earlier
results but at a lesser degree of significance. Public stocks in
agriculture are non-significant and Australian stocks take their
place. In 2. we test whether <u>national</u> public investment is
more important than agricultural public investment alongside the
research association definition of private agricultural investment.
Apparently nothing works in this specification. In 3. we test
whether we can replace both private and public agricultural stocks
with the respective national stocks. As might perhaps be expected
there is no significant association and Australian stocks appear to
be dominant.</p>
<p>Table 6 shows the results when the 'Grants' definition of
private investment is substituted in the estimation. The 'Grants'
set only starts in 1964-65. No 1. shows that the agricultural share
of the grants variable is non-significant as are the other
independent variables in the period 1965-98. No 2. shows that this
result is confirmed</p>

<p>for the 1965-02 period. However, in the spillover case in 3. and
4. both 'all grant stocks' for PVT in 3. combined with agriculture
PUB stocks, and the combination of national stocks for both PVT and
PUB in 4., show significant elasticities for all variables. The
size of the elasticities reflects the percentage increase in the
TFP measure corresponding to a 1 percent change in the total R
&amp; D stocks as the case may be. In 3. the return on total
private stocks is about $2.5 per dollar of stocks. The return on
public stocks is negative $0.96. However the importance of these
experiments relates more to defining a suitable investment proxy
than the estimated rate of return.</p>

<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>The search for a better definition of private investment in R
&amp; D has had mixed results. The specification based on research
associations failed to indicate a significant relationship with
agricultural TFP but showed a just significant relationship for the
market economy for the period 1962-2002 (option 5, Table 1).</p>

<p>However, the specification based on government grants to the
private sector shows more promise. In the market economy (option 7,
Table 1), all four independent variables show significant
association with market economy TFP. In the agricultural sector
(options 1 and 2, Table 6), substituting the grants PVT variable
does not relate to agricultural TFP. However, in the spillover
hypothesis, the national total for stocks based on grants (options
3 and 4, Table 6), has a definite relationship to changes in
agricultural TFP. This suggests that it would be worthwhile to
repeat the Johnson (1999) analysis and the Johnson <em>et al</em>
analysis (2006) based on combined cross section and time series
data.</p>
<p>In summary, the earlier MoRST idea that industries can nominate
the research expenditure that applies to them is a weak one. As it
happens, MoRST has dropped the idea of 'output areas' from more
recent surveys and publications. The presence of any spillovers at
all in the science market negates the idea of specific output
areas. Instead, science knowledge should be regarded as a generally
available pool of knowledge and the science discovery process in
industry should be concerned with determining what is useful in a
particular application out of <em>all</em> that is available.</p>
<p>Further I now question whether the Griliches (1979) notion that
science expenditure can be converted to a stock of knowledge like a
stock of capital assets is a workable proposition. A stock depends
on the perpetual inventory model and needs a specified rate of real
depreciation. Is the accumulation of science knowledge like this?
Can we find some other way of identifying the influence of what is
undoubtedly a large stream of social expenditure?</p>
