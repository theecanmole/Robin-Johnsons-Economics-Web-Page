<h1>Did Peter Gorringe get it right? reflections on the Williamson diagnosis<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym">1</a></sup></h1>
<p class='center'>by</p>
<p class='center'>Robin Johnson</p>
<p class='center'>(formerly Deputy-Director, Economics Division, Ministry of Agriculture)</p>

<p>The Institute of Policy Studies has performed a public service by
publishing  some of the papers on public administration that the late
Peter Gorringe wrote while an official in the New Zealand Treasury<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym">2</a></sup>.
The papers show a breadth and scope that is unusual for a public
servant. They also provide a useful commentary on the public policy
issues that engaged policy makers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The book adds to the earlier book on the economic reforms by Boston,
Martin, Pallot and Walsh<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym">3</a></sup>.</p>
<P>As is well known the author made considerable use of the new
institutional economics in his diagnosis of New Zealand's economic
problems of the period. The papers are full of references to Coase,
Buchanan, North and Williamson. This literature makes common use of
the particular insights of Ronald Coase with regard to transaction
costs and property rights and the constitutional and institutional
implications that follow when transaction costs are non-zero.</p>

<p>It appears to me that Gorringe applies the transaction cost model (to
use this phrase as an overall descriptor) to the policy <i>issues</i>
of the day rather than the policy <i>process</i>. This involves
taking the constitutional structure as a given and
recommending policy change within this paradigm. For example, if one
takes his discussion of the State Sector Act 1988 and the Public
Finance Act 1989 (pp 161-5), the discussion is limited to the
devolution of the management of government departments to chief
executives, and away from central agencies; and the need for a system
of accountability for the goods and services core government agencies
produce. While there is considerable discussion of the agency problem
in this and other contexts, there is no reference (in the published
papers) to the transaction costs of the government policy <i>process</i>
itself.</p>

<p>In previous times this would have been discussed under the rubric of
dead-weight losses in a welfare framework. More recent work by Dixit
and Horn has brought policy implementation into an institutional
framework<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym">4</a></sup>.
Dixit asks what organisational forms will overcome the monopoly of
information held by bureaucrats, the opportunistic behaviour of civil
servants, the problem of divided principals, and government-owned
asset specificity? Horn, independently of Dixit, bases his analysis
on bounded rationality, opportunism, agency theory and transaction
costs in a parliamentary system. He analyses the transaction costs
involved in the political and administrative <i>process</i> including
the cost of achieving durability or lasting impact (the latter turns
out to be a coordination problem).</p>

<p>I believe these frameworks complement the work done by Gorringe (they
appear to have been developed after most of his work was complete).
In this article I set out what the transaction cost model can offer
in this area and suggest some useful applications in the New Zealand
case. I first discuss the interpretation of institutional economics
made by Dixit and Horn and then follow with a discussion of  some of
the implications for public policy analysis.</p>

<h2>The Dixit-Horn hypothesis</h2>

<p class='it'>The role of institutions</p>

<p>The transaction cost model of the political decision process sees
politicians and interest groups resolving their differences by
adopting policy measures that suit both parties. Politicians favour
policies which extend the life of the party[ies] in power while
interest groups favour policies which deliver benefits to them now
and in the future. Interest groups are powerful precisely because
they can influence voting patterns and party finances. Major
transaction costs arise from the difficulties and uncertainties of
maintaining control of the process over time.</p>

<p>Transaction cost economics derives from the work of Ronald Coase who first
posited that when it is costless to transact, the efficient
competitive solution of neoclassical economics obtains<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>It does so because the competitive structure of efficient markets
leads the parties to arrive costlessly at the solution which
maximises aggregate income regardless of the institutional
arrangements. But with information deficiencies and imperfections in
input and product markets further <i>transaction</i> costs are
incurred by the firm in the conduct of its business. It is no longer
costless to transact and the institutional arrangements have a
bearing on the outcome as the base line is no longer the neoclassical
solution.</p>

<p>Proponents of the institutional approach therefore focus on alternative
governance structures in firms and ask what are the <i>net gains</i> after costs of information gathering and maintaining contracts have been taken into account<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym">6</a></sup>. The focus is on organisational alternatives rather than the marginal
conditions. The marginal conditions are seen as some <i>ideal</i>
benchmark which can never be achieved in the real world.</p>

<p>This approach is the basis of Oliver Williamson's analysis of hierarchical
organisations and the economics of vertical and horizontal
integration<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym">7</a></sup>.
It stresses the role of a number of transaction costs that prevent
the pure model of competition working in an imperfect world. In
particular, costs of maintaining and policing contractual obligations
and asset specificity are the determinants of the final outcome.</p>

<p>Can this reasoning be applied to government policy-making and
organisation?  North<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym">8</a></sup>,
 Horn and Dixit are among those who have applied transaction cost
economics to political decision making in the realm of economic
policy. There is a new recognition of the role of governance
structures in policy making institutions. In turn, these constructs
enable policy formation and implementation to be identified
separately from the political process of which they are part.</p>

<p class='it'>Dixit's approach</p>

<p>Dixit develops an organisational approach following the writings of
Buchanan<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote9anc" href="#sdfootnote9sym">9</a></sup>, 
North<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym">10</a></sup>,
and Williamson<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym">11</a></sup>.
In terms of the political process,  <q>the standard normative approach
to policy analysis views this whole process as a
social-welfare-maximising black box, exactly as the neoclassical
theory of production and supply viewed the firm as a
profit-maximising black box.....Economists studying business and
industrial organisation have long recognised the inadequacy of the 
neoclassical view of the firm and developed richer paradigms and
models based on the concepts of various transaction costs</q> (<i>op cit</i>
p.9). Dixit therefore suggests that a better model of the policy
forming process should be based on an analysis of the relevant
transaction costs.</p>

<p>Dixit argues for the inclusion of the political parameters in the analysis
of the policy process. <q>As a crude but effective caricature, one can
say that normative policy analysis began by supposing that the policy
was made by an omnipotent [having infinite power], omniscient
[infinite knowledge], and benevolent dictator. The work on second
best removed the omnipotence. That on information removed the
omniscience. However, the assumptions of benevolence and dictatorship
have remained unaffected by all these improvements in our
understanding of the limits on instruments and information....In
reality, a policy proposal is merely the beginning of a process that
is <i>political</i> at every stage - not merely the process of
legislation, but also the implementation, including the choice or
formation of an administrative agency and the subsequent operation of
this agency</q> (<i>op cit</i> pp 8-9) (<i>italics in original</i>).</p>

<p>Dixit asks what organisational forms will overcome the monopoly of
information held by bureaucrats, the opportunistic behaviour of civil
servants, the problem of divided principals, and government-owned
asset specificity? He identifies <i>transaction costs</i> involved in
overcoming the asymmetric distribution of information between parties
(signaling and screening costs, costs of monitoring and incentives,
auditing costs and costs of misrepresentation), costs involved in
managing agents (monitoring, incentives, and contractual
obligations), costs of agents responding to multiple principals
(coordination of policies, playing off one principal against
another), and costs related to asset specificity (irreversible
investments and lack of durability).</p>

<p>Dixit takes the view that the election process creates a <i>contract</i>
between the politicians (individuals or parties) or administrators
(regulatory agencies etc), and the citizens (individuals or interest
group organisations). The contract is a promise of a policy (or
programme) in return for votes (or contributions). Unlike private
contracts, such policy contracts are difficult to enforce<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym">12</a></sup>.</p>

<p>First, political contracts are rarely between two clearly identifiable
contractors; they have multiple parties (voters or lobbyists) on at
least one side of the relationship. Second, their terms are generally
much more vague (unspoken) than those of economic contracts. They
leave much room for interpretation, and many loopholes for escape and
opportunities to blame third parties or <i>force majeure</i> for
failure to deliver. Thus a promise to cut taxes rarely specifies by
how much, and can be rescinded when the budget situation turns out to
be much worse than expected. In the electoral contract, the citizens
have granted the elected representatives certain powers to collect
taxes and make decisions on their behalf, the only safeguards in this
process remains the free vote and, if this goes, abuse of power is
likely to follow.</p>

<p class='it'>Horn's approach</p>

<p>Horn puts more emphasis on the excessive cost of coordination in the
political process. He spells out some of the details of the exchange
politicians and citizens enter into<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym">13</a></sup>. His interpretation is also driven by bounded rationality,
opportunism, agency theory and transaction costs. He introduces some
of the specifics of the political process and the accompanying
transaction costs, including the cost of durability or lasting
impacts. This is a wider definition of transaction costs than
described by Dixit above.</p>

<p>Horn's transactions approach examines the relationship among three sets of
actors with different roles and motivations. <q>Legislators</q> are the
elected representatives who perform both legislative and executive
functions. Legislation can only be enacted by an <q>enacting coalition</q>
of individual legislators - that is, a group of legislators that is
large enough to guarantee the passage of a bill into law.
Constitutional differences between countries affect such groupings
and the solutions they might seek. <q>Administrators</q> are appointed
rather than elected. They answer to the legislature. Horn assumes
that they do not bring policy preferences to their work!
<q>Constituents</q> conveys the idea of particular groups in society that
have a [vested] interest in the policy making process. Constituents
enjoy the benefits - or suffer the costs - of legislation, offer
support or opposition to legislators, and, ultimately, elect
legislators to office. While these stereotypes tend to simplify the
complexity of the political/administrative process in any one
country, Horn maintains that they are sufficiently general to explain
decisions legislators make about the organisation of public
administration on a broad front.</p>

<p>The approach focuses on the difficulties political decision makers have
in securing continued electoral support on a longer term basis.
Legislators are regarded as self-seeking in their use of legislation
to increase their net political support and lasting power. Their
opportunities are limited by the <i>transaction costs</i> of
achieving agreement on their proposals. These costs are the time and
effort it takes to reach agreement on legislative refinements and any
time and effort that affected private interests subsequently have to
devote to participating in implementation and administration;
political uncertainty that the legislation will last; uncertainty
that the legislation will be administered as intended; and
uncertainty about the distribution of private benefits and costs. If
such relationships are regarded as the hazards of the <q>exchange</q>
between the respective actors, then they are generically similar to
Williamson's <q>far-sighted but incomplete contracting</q>.</p>

<p>The elected/political appointees who are most likely to remain in power
are those who are most successful in overcoming these transaction
problems in the political process, such as those who are best able to
reassure their supporters that the benefits of legislation will not
be lost to administrators in implementation, or undone by subsequent
legislatures. Successful implementation will depend on administrative
agents who do not necessarily share the objectives of the enacting
coalition and its constituents; these divergences create transaction
costs to do with monitoring the performance of such agents and
devising a system of rewards and sanctions that improve performance.
There is no reference to asset specificity in this version of the
model though government administrations are likely to depend on
labour specificity in the administrative staff. Williamson<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym">14</a></sup> notes that asset specificity is negligible in most public sector
departments but human assets in many public bureaucracies involve
considerable specificity (for example, nontransferable training and
social conditioning).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the amount of net electoral support legislators receive from
promoting a piece of legislation depends on the net flow of costs and
benefits that private interests expect it to generate over time.
Implementation bears on this calculus because private interests are
sufficiently forward looking to anticipate how decisions on
implementation will affect the flow of benefits and costs. 
Political support will cease unless they are well pleased (over
time).</p>

<p>Horn's model supplements Dixit's model and brings back the broader concepts
of public choice into main focus. The uncertainties identified by
Dixit (information asymmetry, monitoring of agents and opportunism)
create costs in the political process that have to be overcome if
lasting control of the Treasury benches is to be achieved. The model
posits that the endeavours of the legislators/politicians will
continuously be directed to their own survival. This will be achieved
by paying greater attention to the wishes of their supporters in a
longer term framework. One term of office is never sufficient.</p>

<p>Now in a certain sense, these endeavours can be regarded as an optimal
arrangement of the nation's affairs. The model posits that effective
public administration requires that the transaction costs be
minimised in determining and pursuing society's goals. There will be
pressure from constituents to find least cost solutions to the
problems of the day. There will be limits on the revenue and
challenges from alternative expenditure items including government
programmes. Debate and bargaining will tend toward least cost
solutions.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The insight from the transaction cost model of the political market is
that it mimicks how policy decisions are reached in government
polities rather better than previous constructions. The <q>black box</q>
is opened out. Outcomes are based on the balancing of interests and
the respective power bases of the participants. The balancing of
interests extends to policy implementation and performance.
Influential participants have a vested interest in who is to
implement a policy and on what terms and will influence the political
decision accordingly.</p>

<p>The model recognises that power is unequally distributed and that silent
majorities tend to be forgotten. The balancing process assumes the
interested participants can anticipate future benefits and costs that
affect their welfare and that they will act in this light. The model
assumes that self-interest is dominant to the national interest in
most circumstances.</p>

<p>The model does not require any deep analysis of political motives
but rather sets out a useful framework that explains the process in
which economic policy is conceived and executed. It clearly posits
that decision making has to be a political process subject to
electoral demands and interest group pressure on the one hand, and
national interest concerns contained in rational advice from civil
servants (who may or may not be disinterested) on the other.</p>

<p>It can be utilised to examine the structure of government bureaucratic
organisations.  Williamson offers a detailed analysis of the US
Department of State<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym">15</a></sup>.
He asks: could the organisation of foreign affairs by the Department
of State be replaced by a private bureau? Not surprisingly, perhaps,
he comes to the conclusion that it cannot and that there are specific
tasks for which a government bureau is more suited. These tasks
include situations where hazards of probity (lack of honesty) are to
be avoided  and organisational matters such as dependence on labour
asset specificity (social conditioning and reliance).</p>


<p>The model indicates that blackboard exercises involving producer and
consumer surpluses are of limited use in policy making. The presence
of transaction costs will suggest different solutions to a policy
problem depending where they fall. The case for government
intervention in the market failure case is not clear-cut if the costs
of intervention outweigh the possible benefits. There may be little
or no relationship between the costs and benefits estimated by the
outside observer and the evaluations that individuals place on
alternatives in actual choice situations<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote16anc" href="#sdfootnote16sym">16</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another application is to ask whether the <i>policy advice function</i> in a
government bureau could be contracted out? The Canadian department of
agriculture, Agriculture Canada, explored this option and sponsored a
study of a similar proposal in New Zealand<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym">17</a></sup>.</p>
<p>While the study recognised that alternative sources of advice should
be sought, for informational reasons, it came to the conclusion that
confidentiality and probity concerns made the function more suitable
for a public bureau.</p>

<p>More widely, the international flavour of the analysis overcomes the
dominance of US writing on the subject dependent as it is on
interpretations of the US constitution<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote18anc" href="#sdfootnote18sym">18></a></sup>. Horn, in particular, while developing these ideas at Harvard, has
incorporated the Westminster tradition into his version of the model
and broadened its application to include state-owned profit-making
organisations as well as government-financed bureaus.</p>

<p>While there is an emphasis on democratic governmental decision making,
particularly with regard to maintaining electoral support, the focus
on institutional economics broadens the application to non-democratic
regimes and offers a fruitful avenue of further research. It also
provides an entry point to the analysis of malfeasance and corruption
in government administrations<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym">19</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>Another application is in the distribution and administration of foreign aid.
Many IMF and World Bank programmes are focused on particular national
policy programmes or projects which depend on local initiatives and
execution. The strengths and weaknesses of national administrations
very soon come to the fore when visiting economists seek answers to
poor response rates to massive aid packages. Institutional economics
offers useful guidance to those seeking reform in E. Europe<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym">20</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I have argued elsewhere for a more realistic policy-making framework as
a guide to better policy making<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym">21</a></sup>.
National and international advisors in ministries would benefit from
a better understanding of the institutional background. University
training could benefit from the teaching of more institutional
economics and its practical applications. More university people
could with advantage work in the civil service. General economists
could re-assess their welfare models and voluminous writings in the
professional literature and pay greater regard to the conditions
under which their  policy recommendations will have to operate.</p>
