<h1>Making the ANZSIC work for Economics</h1>

<p class='abstract'>Statistics New Zealand adopted the Australian and New Zealand 
Standard Industrial Classification in 1993 replacing the NZSIC previously in vogue. 
A number of key sectors of the economy are affected by the changes in definition in a way that
makes all new data sets lack compatibility with those that went before. This is
particularly the case with the Philpott collection where the industrial
classification was all NZSIC. Since 1993 Real GDP, Labour Employment and Gross
Capital Investment have all been on a ANZSIC basis. This paper discusses the
problems that were created by the somewhat arbitrary changes that were made and
suggests a methodology of overcoming the matching problem. R&amp;D statistics
collected by MoRST are also classified by the NZSIC system. The paper concludes
with a discussion of the standardisation of R&amp;D statistics to the different
industrial classifications.</p>


<p>Economists are heavily reliant on the
statistical data sources which describe the economy. There is an inherent trust
that the materials have been put together in an objective and scientific
manner. In the industrial classification area, the main disaggregation takes
place for industry by industry analysis. Furthermore the continuing series of
statistics provides the time series for most of the econometric testing of
economic models. The Philpott series of data sets is a good illustration of
productive use that many of these industry by industry collections have been
put. The problem with the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial
Classification (ANZSIC) is that it puts a discontinuity in the time series of
all statistical collections that rely on the industry classification.</p>

<p>ANZSIC was producd by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics and the New Zealand Department of Statistics for use in
the collection and publication of statistics in the two countries. The
development of the ANZSIC resulted from the need to improve comparability of
industry statistics for the two countries. International comparability was
enhanced by aligning the ANZSIC with the International Standard Industrial
Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC), Revision 3, where possible.
Users of industry statistics in both countries have been widely consulted in
the development of the ANZSIC. In preparing the classification considerable
effort has gone into reaching a suitable balance between maintaining historic
comparability and keeping pace with changes in technology and in the business
environment (Preface to the ANZSIC 1993 classification).</p>

<p>This paper is about maintaining historic
comparability in the output, capital and labour employment series on an
industry basis. The series actually reviewed are the Real Gross Domestic
Product estimates on a 1995-96 price base, Full and Part Time Employment, and
Gross Fixed Capital Formation. The capital stocks data employed by Prof
Philpott was derived by him from the NZSIC gross capital formation series and
hence is not an official series (though one has since been published by
Statistics New Zealand). 
We therefore examine the two sets available and see where they can be amalgamated or modified. 
We produce a new set of real GDP data back to 1960 compatible with ANZSIC. We examine full time employment
statistics and their availability and we construct compatible capital formation
and capital stock data for the period 1987-2000. We end with a brief discussion
of industry classification in the MoRST survey of R&amp;D expenditure since
1989.</p>

<h2>Real Gross Domestic Product</h2>

<p>The 1995-96 revision of the Statistics Real
GDP Series involved not only changes to the base year prices, but the
introduction of chain-linking price valuations and a change in the industrial
classification of industries employed (ANZSIC) using SNA93 methodology. All these changes make linking the new
estimates to old estimates produced by Statistics extremely difficult on a consistent basis. 
The well-known Philpott tables (1994, 1999) were based on the Statistics data using the old
classification system (NZSIC) for sectors and on the UNSNA system dated 1968.
Statistics produced several years of the accounts for overlapping years
(1986-96) and according to Haugh (2001) were going to extend the new series
back to years previous to 1986.</p>

<p>In this section I try to identify where the most important changes 
took place and construct a model for revising the Philpott series to be
consistent with the 1995-96 price-based ANZSIC revision. I first assess 
the recalibration work done by Haugh (2001) at Treasury.</p>

<h2>Haugh's Observations</h2>

<p>Statistics New Zealand (SNZ) released upgraded national accounts at the end of 2000 and in mid 2001. These introduced a number of important
changes, including moving from a fixed weight to a chain linked calculation of
constant price data and the introduction of SNA<a class='f' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a> 93 and ANZSIC definitions and
classifications. In what follows, these series are referred to as fixed and chain series respectively.</p>

<p>The new SNA 93 ANZSIC chain series are New Zealand's official data series and replace the previous official
series, which was based on SNA 68 NZSIC fixed weights data. The new chain
series for production sectors is available from the June <u>quarter</u> of 1987
onwards. The fixed series for production sectors is available from September 1977 and the fixed expenditure
series from June 1982. SNZ intend to eventually back date the chain series to the same beginning dates as the fixed
series but no deadline for this has been set.</p>

<p>On the production side<a class='f' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup>3</sup></a>, the type and level of disaggregation of the chain and fixed series
are very similar to that previously provided; i.e. 27 (fixed) and 28 (chain)
industry categories including categories such as agriculture, fishing,
forestry, etc. The chain series has a greater level of disaggregation than the
fixed series with finance and insurance now split out from real estate and business services.</p>

<p>A search for annual GDP data and non-official data also revealed a number of 
potentially useful series. These include the Philpott (1994, 1999)
annual production GDP series that runs from 1960 to 1998 and the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand's (RBNZ) (2001) quarterly expenditure GDP that begins in 1965.</p>
<p>However, in this paper we focus on <u>quarterly data from 1977</u> for several reasons. Quarterly data enable a more precise dating of the timing of any changes in the characteristics of growth and cycles that may have occurred. Furthermore, we want to minimise the chances
that changes in data construction methods will obscure any real change in the
underlying series. Data available from 1977:3 have been consistently derived on an SNA basis.</p>

<h2>Industry Classification</h2>

<p>At a broad level, the industry classifications of the fixed and chain series are similar, but there are some
differences. Therefore, in order to create as comparable fixed and chain series as possible from an industry
classification perspective, a number of transformations were made. </p>

<p>The level of aggregation and classification across the fixed and chain datasets differs in some cases. 
<i>Finance, insurance, business services and real estate</i> is one category in the 
fixed data but is split into <i>Finance and insurance</i> and <i>Real estate and business services</i> in the chain
series. <i>Government and community services</i>, have different classifications in the chain and fixed
series. For example, in the fixed series <i>Community services</i> were classified by provider, i.e. private,
central government and local government. In the chain series they are classified by industry, regardless of
whether the service provider is market or non-market. In order to create comparable categories some industries have
been combined into larger categories.</p><p>For example, the chain <i>Finance, insurance and business services and
real estate</i> series have been summed to create a combined category for
comparability with the fixed series, which is only available at this higher
level of aggregation.</p>

<p>In some cases similarly labelled series, e.g. <i>Other manufacturing</i>, 
are measuring different things in the fixed and chain series because 
they are combinations of different industries under ANZSIC compared to NZSIC. 
<i>Furniture manufacturing</i> has moved from <i>Wood products manufacturing</i> to <i>Other
manufacturing</i>. In three cases, <i>Other manufacturing</i>, 
<i>Wood products manufacturing</i> and <i>Basic metals
manufacturing</i>, a conversion concordance from NZSIC to ANZSIC was used to
create fixed ANZSIC series for comparison with the chain ANZSIC series. 
For example, 75% of the old NZSIC <i>Wood products manufacturing</i> industry 
and 50% of the old NZSIC <i>Pulp and paper</i>
industry have shifted to the new ANZSIC <i>Wood and paper products
manufacturing</i> category. A very approximate fixed weight 
<i>Wood and paper products manufacturing</i> ANZSIC series was created 
by summing 50% of the NZSIC <i>Pulp and paper</i> industry and 75% of the 
NZSIC <i>Wood products manufacturing</i> industry. 
These derived fixed weight ANZSIC series have higher correlations with their chain ANZSIC series counterparts than the
original fixed NZSIC series. For example, for <i>Wood and paper products manufacturing</i> the correlation for first
differences of the logs of the series rises from 0.55 to 0.88.</p>

<p>Wholesale trade <i>Retail trade</i> and <i>Accommodation
&amp; restaurants</i> data are available on a similar basis in both data sets
but the sub-industries <i>Retail trade</i> and <i>Accommodation &amp; restaurants</i>
are only available from June 1986 so these have been combined with <i>Wholesale
trade</i> to make a combined category comparable with wholesale trade from
September 1977 to March 1986.</p>

<h2>Characteristics of the data and a comparison of the fixed and chain series</h2>

<p>The calibration method uses the relationship between the growth rates 
(more specifically the first differences of the logs) of the seasonally adjusted 
chain and fixed volume [quarterly] series. The growth rates as opposed to
the levels are used because the growth rates appear to be stationary while the
levels are not. Visual inspection of the growth rate data indicates that in particular 
they fluctuate around a long run constant mean with stable variance although they may 
move from local mean to local mean within the business cycle. The Phillips-Peron test also indicated that all the growth series (both
fixed and chain) were stationary apart from owner occupied dwellings for both
the fixed and chain series, which show some short-term trending behaviour.</p>

<p>The chain and fixed series growth rates were compared by industry in two ways.
The first method was to compare the mean and standard deviation of the <u>quarterly
growth rates</u> for the period June 1987 to June 2000 for which there was
common data. The second method of comparison was to construct both scatter and time series plots of the growth
rates of the chain and fixed series by industry to examine how well the two
series were related and how time affected the relationship if at all.</p>

<p>Figure 1 shows the difference between the mean <u>quarterly</u> growth rates 
for the chain and fixed series by industry. Figure 2 shows the
difference between the standard deviation of the quarterly growth rate for the
chain and fixed series by industry over the period 1987 to 2000.</p>

<p>Figure 1: Chain minus Fixed Mean Quarterly Growth Rates 1987 to 2000</p>
<img src="r04ef1.png" width="90%" height="90%" alt="Figure 1" align="middle">
<p>Figure 2: Chain minus Fixed standard deviation for the period 1987 to 2000</p>

<p>The comparison of mean growth rates shown in Figure 1 illustrates that the mean growth rates for total
production GDP are very similar. The mean growth rate for the chain series is
only 0.04 percentage points higher than the fixed series. By industry, the range is from 0.6
percentage points for <i>Other manufacturing</i> to 0.4 percentage points for <i>Wood
and paper manufacturing</i> (chain- fixed).</p>
<p>As noted above the <i>Other manufacturing</i> and <i>Wood product
manufacturing</i> series have been affected by new industry definitions, which
have resulted in <i>Furniture manufacturing</i> moving from <i>Wood and paper
product manufacturing</i> to <i>Other manufacturing</i>, and <i>Pulp and paper</i>
moving from <i>Printing, publishing, pulp and paper</i> to <i>Wood and paper
manufacturing</i>. For 23 out of the 29 industries including the 5 main sectors, the quarterly growth means for the
chain and fixed weight series are within +/-0.2 percentage points of each
other. </p>

<p>Using visual examination of the time series plots, the industries and total GDP were
divided into 3 broad categories: (1) chain and fixed series that are noticeably different over the
whole period (September 1987 to June 2000); (2) chain and fixed series that are
very similar over the first half of the period but the relationship is less
clear in the second half; and (3) series where the relationship between the
chain and fixed series is very similar for the whole period.</p>

<p>There are only two small industries in category (1), <i>Mining</i> and <i>other manufacturing</i>. The upgrade of the national accounts has led
to significant changes in these series and even after correcting for ANZSIC
changes in <i>Other manufacturing</i> the relationship between the 2 series is
more diffuse than for other industries. The calibrated results for these two industries should therefore be
treated with more caution than for other industries.</p>

<p>The industries in category (2) might contain a <u>structural break</u> 
in the relationship between the chain and the fixed series because in some 
cases SNZ have used a method for calculating the series from the June 1994 
quarter that differs from the method used prior to this date. For example, sub-component
volume indexes for some industries, e.g. meat and dairy volume indexes for the <i>Primary
food manufacturing</i> industry have been calculated using updated 1996
commodity weights but the new weights have only been used from June 1994
onwards. In other manufacturing industries, ANZSIC producer prices have been
used in deflation from June 1994, but weighted NZSIC producer prices were used
prior to this date. Any changes in the methodology affecting the price indexes used in deflation could flow through to
the constant price series. In other cases for example, <i>Wholesale trade</i>, <i>Retail trade</i> and <i>Accommodation,
cafes and restaurants</i> calculations are performed with a finer level of
detail than previously but the changes have only been backdated to June 1994. 
Prior to 1994 these series are linked to weighted proportions of old NZSIC sub-component series.</p>

<h2>Structural Breaks</h2>

<p>At the 5% level of significance the null hypothesis of no structural break was only rejected for <i>Combined wholesale trade</i>; <i>Electricity, gas and water</i>; <i>Forestry</i>; <i>Owner
occupied dwellings</i>; and <i>Other food manufacturing</i>. For the first two industries there is also
clear visual evidence of a structural break, with the relationship becoming
more diffuse in the second half of the data.</p>

<p>Statistics New Zealand have calculated these industries with different
weights and/or a finer level of detail than previously but only made these
changes to the series back to June 1994.</p>
<p>As these changes will not be made to the series prior to June 1987 either,
the relationship between the fixed and chain series for these two industries is
best captured by estimating the relationship for the period June 1987 to March
1994 only.</p>

<p>Haugh offers correction factors for the <i>Wood, Paper, Printing, &amp;
Other Manufacturing</i> sectors based on splits/concordances (derived I presume
from Stats before and after [quarterly?} tables) as to how they were classified
before and after SNA 93 and ANZSIC. He also has a split for <i>Basic Metals and
Machinery</i>. I have applied these to the Philpott series in 1987-88 and
produced plausible substitutes that are price consistent with the overall
change in prices between the data based on 1982-83 prices and that based on
1995-96 prices. <i>Wholesale Trade</i>, and <i>Finance and Insurance</i>, are
amalgamated by Haugh and thus satisfy his tests. As Philpott used this
aggregation in his series (and has not recorded the individual components) this
overcomes any problems for our conversion. Finally, <i>Government Services</i>
and <i>Personal Services</i> show unusual price changes between the two bases
which suggest the content or the methodology has been changed between the two
revisions (discussed below).</p>

<h2>Building the model</h2>

<p>I propose to use the Haugh conversion factors where they apply and check these 
against the before and after <u>annual</u> estimates for 1987-88 at 1995-96 prices. 
Statistics (Nick Treadgold) inform me that for <i>Communications</i> and <i>O-O Dwellings</i> 
there are no changes between ANZSIC and NZSIC definitions. Small changes made were 
due to the re-estimation of the consumption of fixed capital and the capitalisation 
of computer software in the former.</p>

<p>For <i>Government</i>, there were significant differences.between ANZSIC and NZSIC. 
While <i>Local Government</i> was unchanged, education and health components of 
<i>Central Government</i> were moved into <i>Personal Services</i>. 
<i>Personal Services</i> also have a number of other changes which 
increase the differences slightly.</p>

<p>From these comparisions I have constructed the following adjustments to the Philpott
industry categories in 1987-88 as in Box 1.</p>

<div class="c5">
<p class='by'> Box 1: Concordance Factors for Real GDP in 1987-88 </p>

<p>I. Assume 30% of <i>Wood and Wood Products</i> is <i>Furniture</i> (rest
combines with balance of <i>Paper Products</i> to form <i>Wood and Paper Product Manufacturing</i>).</p>

<p>II. Assume 54% of <i>Paper Products, Printing &amp; Publishing</i> is <i>Printing
and Publishing</i> (balance to <i>Wood and Paper Product Manufacturing</i>).</p>

<p>III. Asume 30% of <i>Machinery &amp; Metal
Products</i> is <i>Fabricated Metal Products</i> and add to <i>Basic Metal
Product Manufacturing</i> (balance is <i>Machinery and Equipment</i>).</p>

<p>IV Add <i>Furniture</i> to <i>Other</i></p>

<p>V. Maintain <i>Finance, Insurance, Property and Business Services</i> as an
aggregate</p>

<p>VI. Assume <i>Government (Central and Local)</i> is 34% of combined total of
<i>Government</i> and <i>Personal Services</i> (the ratio in 1987-88).</p>

<p>VII. All other industries assumed to be defined approximately the same in both classifications.</p>
</div>

<p>These are percentage ratios and can be applied to Philpott's data
still expressed in 1982-83 prices. Philpott's industry classification now
becomes ANZSIC based.</p>

<h2>Comment</h2>

<p>This all assumes that these concordance
ratios hold constant back thru time. We want to go back to 1960. By taking
1987-88 proportions we preserve any trend shown in the Philpott data but the
absolute amounts would be increasingly distorted for the industries concerned
the further we go back. As an alternative I could suggest that we simply weld
the Philpott data to the ANZSIC data base (as I have done previously) by
matching the old data to the new data at a common year. This would preserve the
trend in the old data but the absolutes would still have less meaning compared
with the ANZSIC-adjusted framework. </p>

<p>Finally we need to think about the base
year prices of the restored series. It would be convenient to bring the past
data into 1995-96 prices as far as the present chain-linked series is
concerned; but how long will Statistics stay with this price base? For some
purposes, it will be necessary to continue the old series at 1982-83 prices. I
have re-worked the implicit price comparisions between the 82-83 base and the
95-96 base by industries when the above corrections are taken into account. A
full chain linked series back to 1960 will have to wait until the Statistics
revisions are finished.</p>

<h2> Employment by Industry </h2>

<p>Up to 1990, Philpott (1994) based his estimates on the Quarterly Employment Survey. Agriculture was estimated from the Agricultural Census. In Philpott (1999), he based his estimates on the
Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS). The data are March year annual averages
of the quarterly HLFS statistics with full time equivalents calculated as one
part time worker = 0.35 a full time worker (RPEP No 293). This data was welded
to the earlier QES data from <u>1987</u>.</p>

<p>I have continued this series up to March year <u>2002</u> by asking Statistics to recalculate the full- time and part-time employment by industry on the same basis. The new data is welded to
the old data from1<u>997-98</u>. This set is only NZSIC compatible. (See file "philpott base xls")</p>

</div>
<p>According to Statistics ( J Morris) current labour employment statistics are ANZSIC based back to 1996.
Part-time workers are weighted at 0.5 FTEs. FTEs from the QES are available at
the ANZSIC industry 1 level (excluding agriculture) from 1989 to the present.
Up to June 2003, there was a transition period in the conversion from NZSIC to
ANZSIC while both codes were used. The March 2003 quarter of the HLFS featured a 
change to the industry coding system [on the returned questionaires] on an ANZSIC 
basis at the 3 digit ANZSIC level.
This was to overcome certain non-sampling error problems like identifying the
correct industry a firm belonged to and other possible processing errors.
NZSIC-based statistics have been discontinued.</p>

<p>Thus Philpott's series were never compatible with the published weighted series though they were compatible
with the QES data itself. Statistics has ongoing research to take the ANZSIC
series back to 1970.(J Morris). In the meantime the only long term series is
that of Philpott which is not compatible with ANZSIC-based real GDP. I have not
investigated a concordance system that might align the NZSIC based data to
ANZSIC.</p>

<h2>Gross Capital Formation and Capital Stocks</h2>

<p>I will discuss the Philpott approach first
and then the approach adopted later by Statstics New Zealand. We start with
capital investment in each industry and then proceed to estimating stocks of
capital. In later work, Philpott (1994,
1999) used the GCF values given in the Expenditure estimates of GDP in the
aggregate and industry estimates from NZIER. as Statistics had not generated
the data for industry GCF after 1990 at that time. Statistics has now produced 
a new GCF series from 1972 to 1997 (recently up-dated to 1999) on the 
ANZIND classification. ANZIND is is an ANZSIC based classification
used to group industries for publication ( Nick Treadgold). Philpott's data is
all NZSIC based.</p>

<p>For deflating the nominal series of GCF, Philpott used the implicit deflator for GCF from the aggregate expenditure GDP series. This applied across all industries. In updating Philpott's stock series
to 1999 I have used the All Groups Capital Goods Price index which has been
available since December 1989 and the Stats GCF data from 1990-91. The same
price index is used across all industries. Philpott appears to have been
slightly under-estimating the absolute level of nominal CGF though not of real
GCF. e.g.</p>

<p>While the Stats GCF data is ANZSIC consistent, I have not adjusted it to an NZSIC basis in these estimates. Where the largest discrepancies occur (in the same industries as for real GDP) the
percentage changes in the ANZSIC series have been married to Philpott's NZSIC
data sets.</p>

<ol style='' start=1 type=1>
 <li><u>Philpott Net Capital Stocks</u></li>
</ol>

<p>Net Capital Stocks refer to an perpetual inventory (PIM) series of Philpott's 
which assumes wastage of assets is equal to the IRD rates of depreciation for 
land and buildings, and plant and equipment. Starting values are derived from 
balance sheet data for 1950 (RPEP Paper 270). Philpott derived stock values 
for buildings and plant separately and then added them. Each year deflated 
capital investment is added and depreciation deducted. The end-of-year values 
become the starting values for the following year.</p>

<p>The new Statistics series on capital formation does not give buildings 
and plant separately so my updating averages the depreciation rates and 
applies the PIM model to the aggregates (This information can be obtained 
from Stats if needed). To obtain average depreciation over both types of
asset the actual <q>wastage</q> in 1990-91 in each sector was estimated from
Philpott's data for that year and applied to subsequent years. Over all groups,
the average wastage in that year was 6.25%. This could vary slightly from year
to year as the industry weightings change.</p>

 <li><u>Philpott Gross Capital Stocks</u></li>
</ol>

<p>Gross Capital Stocks refer to stocks where wastage is estimated by a time of 
retirement methodology. Basically assets stay in use until they are discarded. 
This methodology requires estimates of the <q>life</q> 
of an asset (Philpott calls them service lives). He says: <cite>&lsquo;Consistent with the OECD approach we assumed that assets began to be retired at a point in time 20%
earlier than their average service life and that this retirement concluded at a
point 20% later than that date and that the retirement process was
linear&rsquo;</cite>. For an asset of life 20 years,
the wastage would be spread as one eighth from year 16 to year 24 (RPEP Paper
No 105).</p>

<p>Starting values were estimated for 1950 and a profile of retirement rates estimated for that year and spread over
subsequent years. All new investment was then retired by the rules outlined
above.</p>

<p>For up-dating purposes we do not have these
time profiles of the Philpott gross stock estimates. It is possible, however,
to estimate what the end-effect is in any one year by deducting capital
investment from the change in gross stocks. This varies from industry to
industry (with different service lives assumed) and in 1990-91 the national
retirement of assets was 2.003% of the stock at the beginning of the year.
Transport was as high as 5.46% and Electricity was 1.22% per year. </p>

<p>It follows that this percentage will not be constant but will vary according 
to the time profile of capital investment 20-40 years earlier. Here is a comparison 
for some industries for 1996-97 compared with 1990-91:</p>
<table class="c5">
<tr><th colspan="5">Implicit Wastage</th></tr>
<tr><td class='l'>Industry</td><td colspan="2">1990-91</td><td colspan="2">1996-97</td></tr>

<tr><td class='l'>All Groups</td><td>$4378</td><td>2.003</td><td>$4640</td><td>1.837</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Apparently, the amount being discarded is
getting larger except in the case of agriculture. This reflects higher
investment in some earlier period. While the total amount being discarded is higher
it is lower in percentage terms as the stock has grown larger in the interim.</p>

<p>For my updating I have assumed that the 1990-91 depreciation/wastage rates for each
industry category held throughout the 1990s.</p>

 <li><u>Statistics Net Capital Stocks<o:p></o:p> </u></li>
</ol>
<p> Statistics prepared their own capital stock series in 1999. To do this they updated the
GCF data from 1990 on an ANZIND basis. They have published a current price
series of capital stocks on an industry basis back to 1972 and a 1995-96 price
chain linked industry series back to 1972. These estimates of stocks use the
same GCF series as used above for the Philpott corrections, but the base stocks
and depreciation rates are defined differently.</p>

<p>In Statistics (2000) <i>gross capital stock </i>is defined as <q>accumulated investment less the
accumulated value of the assets no longer operating (that is, retired)</q>. <i>Net
capital stock</i> represents accumulated investment less retirements
and accumulated depreciation for assets still operating (that is, gross capital
stock less accumulated depreciation on assets still in operation).
Depreciation figures are based on assets valued at current replacement cost
and consistent rates of depreciation which better approximate the useful lives
of assets.</p>

<p>In summary:</p>

<p class="abstract">Opening balance sheet value of a specific asset, <u>plus</u><br/>
Value of assets aquired, <u>less</u><br/>
Value of assets disposed of or depreciated, <u>plus</u><br/>
Value of other positive or negative changes (war destruction), <u>plus</u><br/>
Value of the positive or negative holding gains accruing during the period such as cost of
replacement, <u>equals</u><br/>
Value of stock of asset in closing balance sheet.</p>

<p>Statistics (Pipat Wongsaart) say that, as a result of market forces, 
<u>the purchaser's price of a new fixed asset should provide a good initial estimate of the present value
of the future rentals</u>. This applies to all years throughout the period covered. Hence, net capital stock for each of these years can be defined as the total values of fixed assets in a particular year taking into account the asset's efficiency loss and cost of capital. I have not sighted a table of
service lives or how it is treated in individual industries.</p>

<p>Thus these estimates differ from Philpott in the way they take account of disposal of
assets and in the way they take account of extraneous events. I am not clear
how the service life definition differs. I remember Brian Easton has raised
this issue of lost assets previously in discussion of the Philpott data.</p>

<p>The chart (next page) shows Philpott's two real series as compared with the new Stats real
series all in 1995-96 prices. Philpott's net stocks are growing more slowly
than the Stats estimate due to higher depreciation (IRD rates). In 1999-2000 Stats are 46% higher than
Philpott net stocks. On the other hand, Philpott's gross stock series are 24%
higher than Stats net stocks (as might be expected) in 1999-2000 due to the
lower wastage through his assumption of service lives and his lack of data on
asset disposal. If the increment of investment is common to Stats and Philpott
(as adjusted by myself), the difference in growth must be due to
depreciation/wastage/write-off rates</p>

<p>Can Stats series be used for econometric work? They are ANZSIC consistent and hence match the
revised real GDP data base for industry from 1972. Social capital definitions
need to be looked at. Only the current employment data is not ANZSIC consistent
before 1989. So Ralph can do production functions on a consistent basis from
1989 to the present using Stats data. This is a lot of work to get such a
simple answer, Ralph!</p>

<h2>Concluding</h2>
<p>Stats has seriously disturbed the historical collection of macroeconomic statistics in NZ
by introducing ANZSIC. They say they had some regard for continuity of previous
statistical collections. It seems to me that the authors should have had a plan
to convert GDP, employment and GCF on a similar basis for similar time periods
back to some common date in the past. At the moment it would be a good idea if
someone extended back the employment statistics on an ANZIND basis back to 1972 
as a matter of priority (I am assured [by J Morris] that a team is
working on it).</p>

<h2>Appendix 1: Building the R &amp; D Data Set</h2>

<p>(i) <u>R &amp; D Expenditure</u></p>

<p>Since 1989, MoRST have carried out annual
or semi-annual surveys of R &amp; D expenditure in New Zealand (MoRST var). These
carefully delineate research expenditure in the major providers of research;
government, firms and universities, and also identify which productive sectors
the research is aimed at. The surveys also carefully differentiate between 
<i>funding</i>functions and <i>provider</i> functions. Thus for the period
1989-90 to 2000-01 there is a detailed record of research expenditure on a
provider (who carries it out) and a funder basis (who pays for it) including
the designated sectors to which the research is directed. For the analysis of
impacts of this research endeavour, the <i>provider</i> basis of R &amp; D is the best guide.</p>

<p>For the period from 1989 back to 1962, the record of Government 
expenditure on R&amp;D is almost complete. Total departmental funding
 is faithfully recorded in the Department of Statistics'
Yearbooks and by NRAC and designated industries affected by areas of research
are identified on a broad basis. Some extrapolation of data is required to get
sectoral public expenditure back to 1962 on a consistent basis. </p>

<p>(ii) <u>NZSIC Groups</u></p>

<p>In combination with the productive sectors
recognised in the MoRST surveys, the Yearbook coverage determined the number of
sectors which could be analysed for the whole period back to 1960 (R&amp;D
sector below). As the productivity data is presented on a national accounting
basis (SNA) according to NZSIC, the following schema shows the sectoral
allocation used in my research papers:</p>

<p><b>Appendix 2: Letter from Statistics New Zealand</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>12 May 2004</p>

<p>In summary, we would not agree that Statistics New Zealand have seriously disturbed the historical economic series.
or have the changes in ANZSIC been arbitarily made:</p>

The adoption of ANZSIC was introduced to align the industrial classification used by Statistics New Zealand with
other international agencies.</p>

<p>Industrial classifications need to be updated perioically to reflect changes in technology and the business
environment.</p>

<p>Users are consulted throughout the process of classification revisions.</p>

<p>The range of industrial classifications will be wider when backdating has been completed. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>The output series is in the process of being
backdated on an ANZSIC basis. When completed (November 2004) the range and
length of published series will be the same as was availble under NZSIC.</li>

<li>Labour input series are currently being
backdated on an ANZSIC basis to 1972. This will be the first time that a
comprehensive industry labour series has been compiled that is consistent with
output and capital statistics. The primary purpose of the labour series is for
the calculation of multi-factor productivity estimates that will align as cosely as possible to the
GDP added value series.</li></ul>

<p>The range of capital series has been extended significantly since ANZSIC was introduced. Official capital
expenditure series by NZSIC industry were previously only available between
1972 and 1987. Since the shift to ANZSIC, these series (both nominal and real)
have been backdated to 1972 and are updated on an annual basis (usually t-3).</p>

<p>In addition to capital expenditure series, productivity capital stock, net capital stock, and consumption of fixed
capital (replacement cost) by industry have been compiled from 1972 to t-3.
None of these series were not available under NZSIC.</p>

<p>The differences between the capital stock series produced by Philpott and Statistics New Zealand are due to some
significant differences in assumptions and methodologies. This would appear to
fall outside the purpose of this paper.</p>

<p>Statistics New Zealand's capital stock series have been compiled consistently with the
methodologies outlined in the OECD Manual <q>Measuring Capital Stock</q>. The main
pointof difference is the use of rental prices to weight together assets. This
is not currently done in the StatisticsNew Zealand model.</p>

<p>A couple of points of clarification:</p>

<p>The mining industry has been significantly affected by conceptual changes introduced with SNA93. Where
previously mineral exploration was treated as a current expense it is now
capitalised and included in gross fixed capital formation</p>

<p>The methodology for compiling primary food manufacturing has not changed between pre-1994 and post-1994. The series
have simply been rebased. 1995-96 is the expression period, not the base
period. Under chain-linking, the base period is effectively updated on an
annual basis.</p>

<p>Note that the ANZIND classification is also that used to publish the output (real GDP) and capital series. It is also
that which will be used for the backdated employment series.</p>

<p>Splits of buildings and plant gross fixed capital formation (both nominal and real)are readily available in
Statistics New Zealand's published output.</p>

<p>The HLFS is only ANZSIC based back to 1996. This because the HLFS does not code industry low enough to allow a full
concordance to be used . Similarly the period up to March (not June as stated)
2003 with dual coding also refers to the HLFS.</p>

<p>The QES is available on ANZSIC back to 1989.</p>
