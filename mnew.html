<p>This was a paper presented to the July 1988 annual meeting of the NZ branch of the Australasian Agricultural Economics Society. Here is the abstract.</p>
<p class='abstract'>This paper reviews changes in the agribusiness sector since 1984. Evidence is based on available statistics and some anecdotal information. Considerable changes are identified in factor markets, input markets and service markets. Main features include rapid increases in factor productivity, stabilization of service prices (except interest), a decline in investment and a decline in balance sheet assets. Amalgamation and restructuring has occurred in the input and service industries and surplus capacity still exists at several points. Outputs can only be maintained at current high levels by disinvestment in the capital base. The agribusiness sector is likely to settle down at some new lower level of output and investment with increased levels of productivity in the medium term.</p> 


<h6>10 February 2010. </h6>

<p>John Key's <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1002/S00092.htm">statement to Parliament</a> of 9 February 2010 proposes more economic growth through more mining in conservation areas. He states that mining uses only 40 square kilometres of land which is less than 0.015 percent of NZ's total land; that new mining will meet strict environmental tests and that increased mining will improve the natural environment via an "off-setting" conservation fund. I have included his words at the end of the post</p>

<p>I immediately sent this email to John Key.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>john.key@national.org.nz <john.key@national.org.nz>

<p>Dear Mr Key,</p>

<p>I have just read your Statement to Parliament about economic goals. I am absolutely shocked and disappointed that your Government intends to increase mining on conservation lands via a review of Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act. That policy is completely contrary to the statutory conservation management purpose of those lands.</p>

<p>I am astounded that you as the Minister of Tourism cannot see how damaging this is to 'Brand New Zealand', our clean and green image.</p>

<p>I am also completely unconvinced by your assertion that mining will have to meet strict environmental tests and your comment that mining only occupies 40 hectares of land in the whole of New Zealand. The area of land occupied is not a good indicator of the level of adverse effects of mining. Have you not heard of acid mine drainage, the water pollution from heavy metals which flows out from mines and into rivers? Does your quoted return per hectare from mining include rehabilitation of water ways?</p>

<p>It is clear to me that of all land uses in New Zealand, mining has the highest adverse environmental impact per hectare. It is simply nonsense to suggest that this damage can be either mitigated or compensated for.</p>

<p>I urge you instead to do two things.</p>

<p>The first is to provide statutory protection from mining for all conservation land as if Schedule 4 included all conservation land.</p>

<p>Secondly I urge you to follow up on the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment's <a href="http://www.pce.parliament.nz/reports_by_subject/all_reports/energy__and__climate/stockton_revisited_the_mine_and_regulatory_minefield">recommendation</a> that current mines on conservation land be required to replace their antiquated mining permits that have no environmental safeguards with adequate consents with up to date mitigation conditions.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p></blockquote>

<p>Here are the paragraphs of his statement concerning mining in conservation areas.</p>

<blockquote><i><p></p>"There is also extraordinary economic potential in the mineral estate residing in Crown-owned land. Mining in New Zealand uses just 40 square kilometres of land, less than 0.015 percent of our total land area. The export value of that land however is $175,000 per hectare, which makes mining an extremely valuable use of land.</p>

<p>The Government will shortly be releasing a discussion document for public consultation on potential changes to Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act. Schedule 4 is the part of the Crown Minerals Act which prohibits mining or prospecting on specified areas of Crown land.</p>

<p>The discussion document will recommend that some areas of Crown land be removed from Schedule 4 and in addition that some areas currently not in Schedule 4 be added to it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the public consultation process, it is my expectation that the Government will act on at least some of these recommendations and make significant changes to Schedule 4. This is because new mining on Crown land has the potential to increase economic growth and create jobs.</p>

<p>I know some people have expressed concern about increased mining but I can assure New Zealanders that any new mines on conservation land will have to meet strict environmental tests.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Government is also proposing to establish a new Conservation Fund, potentially drawing on royalty revenue from mining operations on Crown land. The Conservation Fund would resource special conservation projects around the country. That means that if there is an increase in mining activity, New Zealand’s natural environment would also be improved."</p></i></blockquote>

<h6>6 February 2010 New Zealand's climate change policy takes us down the Yale Environment Performance Index</h6>
<a href="nzepi-v4.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 0px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 850px; height: 800px;" src="nzepi-v4.png" alt="" id="NZ Yale EPI 2009" border="0"></a>
<p><a href="http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2010/02/nz_15th_of_163_for_environmental_health.html">Kiwiblog</a> notes that New Zealand ranks 15th in the <a href="http://epi.yale.edu/Home">Environmental Performance Index 2010</a>. No Right Turn notes that New Zealand's rank has <a href="http://norightturn.blogspot.com/2010/02/fallen.html">fallen</a> from 7th to 15th.</p>

<p>Rather than blog about it I thought I would graph it. Note that New Zealand is doing worst in all the climate change categories. That high score for agricultural subsidies, fourth in the list, is because the taxpayer is going to subsidise the agriculture sector under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Emissions_Trading_Scheme">NZ Emissions Trading Scheme</a>.</p>

<h6>23 January 2010 Seventy percent fossil fooled</h6>
<p>Quite often I hear politicians or journalists say that New Zealand can't really be expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels as 70% of our energy is renewable, due mainly to our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power_in_New_Zealand">hydro power schemes</a>.
A typical recent example was business journalist Fran O'Sullivan, writing in the <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/best-of-business-analysis/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501241&amp;objectid=10614301&amp;pnum=3">New Zealand Herald</a> on December 9, 2009.</p>

<p>O'Sullivan wrote this about NZ's positioning on climate change prior to the UNFCCC summit at Copenhagen.</p>
<p><i>"Where the Government negotiators will focus is on getting across New Zealand's position...the fact that 70 per cent of energy is renewable leaves little room for gains on that score"</i></p>

<p>The trouble is this 'truism' is not only a bad reason for not reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it is also factually incorrect. As the barchart shows, renewable energy including Hydro power supplies 30% of New Zealand's energy supply.  Fossil fuels supply 70%.</p>
<a href="NZ_Energy4.png"><img style="margin: 0px auto 0px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 650px; height: 550px;" src="NZ_Energy4.png" alt="" id="NZ Energy 2009" border="0"></a>
<p>So, I sent Fran an email.</p>
<p><i>"Fran, You state; "Where the Government negotiators will focus is [in respect of climate change negotiations] on getting across New Zealand's position...the fact that 70 per cent of energy is renewable leaves little room for gains on that score, and that agriculture makes up 50 per cent of emissions." I think you are confusing electricity generation with NZ's gross energy supply. Only 30 percent of NZ's gross energy supply is renewable. Refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_New_Zealand">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_New_Zealand</a> and the Ministry of Economic Development 2009 <a href="http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____41143.aspx">energy figures</a>. Kind regards"</i></p>

<p>Fran replied the same morning<i> "Yes you are right. Real oversight on my behalf will get it corrected on website"</i>.</p>

<p>As I write this, six weeks later, the '70%-renewable' statement is still on the NZ Herald website. We seem doomed to be seventy percent fossil fooled for a while longer.</p>

<h6>9 January 2010 More on the Story of Cap and Trade</h6>
<p>This post will also appear on the <a href="http://www.kennett.co.nz/rameka/">Project Rameka blog</a>. It includes the Story of Cap and Trade video again.</p>
<p>My friends Jonathan Kennett and Bronwen Wall set up <a href="http://www.kennett.co.nz/rameka/">'Project Rameka'</a>, a carbon sink project near Takaka. I am one of the trustees of this project.</p>
<p>The three of us are climate-change junkies and we have been going to some   <a href="http://ips.ac.nz/events/previous_events-2009.html">talks about climate change</a>  hosted by Victoria University of Wellington.</p> <p>Jonathan has posted on a talk by  <a href="http://www.kennett.co.nz/rameka/2009/10/critical-climate-change-update.html">NIWA's main climate scientist David Wratt</a> and on a talk about
<a href="http://www.kennett.co.nz/rameka/2009/07/latest-science-on-sea-level-rise.html">sea level rise and the Antarctic 'Andrill' ice-core drilling project</a>.</p> 
<p>Usually, we grab something to eat afterwards, and have a yarn about what we thought of the talk.</p>
<p>One talk I went to by myself was about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Emissions_Trading_Scheme">NZ emissions trading scheme</a>. I caught up with Bronwen and Jonathan soon afterwards and filled them in on the talk. They both thought I should post on the Project Rameka blog about the NZ emissions trading scheme (or "ETS" for short), as it has implications for the carbon credits that Project Rameka, as a carbon sink, will be eligible to receive.</p> 
<p>Also, shortly afterwards, Climate Issues Minister Nick Smith <a href="http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/balanced+new+law+important+step+climate+change%7Ctitle=Balanced%20new%20law%20important%20step%20on%20climate%20change">rammed through some major changes</a> to the 2008 Labour version of the ETS, in a big rush so New Zealand would look like a country with a good climate change policy at the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen">UN climate summit at Copenhagen</a>.  <a href="http://hot-topic.co.nz/copenhagen-closes-too-little-too-late/">Yeah, right!</a></p>

<p>I have been trying to write this post for a while now. It's a massively complex scheme and I had been struggling to come up with something readable about it. Jonathan has said, correctly of course, that it's got to be short and easy to read, each post no longer than about 500 words, and not too technical. 'Mission impossible', I thought, then I joked to Jonathan: "What say I sum it up in a cartoon?"</p> 
<p>But, joking aside, I found a video about emissions trading! That's got to be easier to take in than reading some jargon-heavy blurb about economics and climate change! Here it is!</p>

<p>The video is called <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/capandtrade.php">The Story of Cap and Trade</a> from Annie Leonard who was behind <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/">the Story of Stuff viral video</a>.</p>

<object height="205" width="400"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7908590&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1"><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7908590&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="205" width="400"></embed></object>
<p>'The Story of Cap and Trade' gives us a nice simple definition of an emissions trading scheme.</p>
<ol><li>There has to be an annual limit on carbon emissions, a 'Cap'.</li>
<li>The 'Cap' is the total number of 'permits to pollute' or emissions permits.</li>
<li>The 'Cap', and obviously the number of permits, declines over time.</li>
<li>Within the 'Cap', innovative companies that reduce their emissions can sell permits to other companies, the 'Trade'.</li></ol>
<p>Annie Leonard says 'we get rich and we save the planet! What's not to like'.</p>
<p>But, seriously, Annie Leonard says there are <b>several pretty major things not to like</b> about emissions trading:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Free 'giveaways' of permits to the polluters (which undermines the price incentive not to emit).</li>
 	<li>Offsetting - polluters may buy unverified permits that do not represent valid emissions reductions, so 			emissions don't reduce.</li>
 	<li>Climate injustice to less-developed countries, where many 'offset' projects are set up.</li>
	<li>The lack of internationally agreed Caps.</li></ol>
	<p>Consequently, Annie Leonard concludes that 'Cap and Trade' is a distraction from real policies that reduce emissions, and is really about maintaining 'business as usual'.</p>
	<p>There is also a 'Story of Cap and Trade' <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/_images/pdfs/annie_leonard_footnoted_script.pdf">annotated referenced script (PDF)</a>, and a <a href="http://www.storyofstuff.com/capandtrade/FAQs.php">FAQ</a>.</p>What do you think of the video? I think it's great explanation of a hard topic.</p>
	
<h6>23 December 2009 The Story of cap and trade</h6>
<p>I have been meaning to write something about emissions trading and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Emissions_Trading_Scheme">NZ Emissions Trading Scheme</a> for a  while. Instead here is a video by Annie Leonard which describes emissions trading in a fairly simple way.</p>

<object width="400" height="205"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7908590&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7908590&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="205"></embed></object><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/7908590">The Story of Cap & Trade</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/storyofstuff">Story of Stuff Project</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>Leonard's main criticisms are:</p>
<ol><li>emission permits will be given away free to emitters, in effect, rewarding them for causing the problem. That will certainly be the case in New Zealand, where billions of $NZ worth of permits will be allocated to agriculture and trade exposed and emissions intensive industries over an 80-year period.</li>
<li>emission offsets (carbon offsets) will be fraudulently obtained, thus undermining the cap on emissions.</li>
<li>caps on emissions are essential to a cap and trade scheme, but there are no internationally agreed caps.</li>
<li>emissions trading is a distraction from the real measures to decarbonise economies, and as such it encourages 'business as usual'.</li></ol>  

<p>Kate Sheppard, writing on the Mother Jones website, says that Leonard <a href="http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2009/12/story-cap-and-trade">grossly simplifies emissions trading</a>. I am not so sure.</p>
<p>23 October 2009. I have uploaded another paper. It is '<a href="rwmj1992h.html">The Resource Management Act and property rights</a>', from the Proceedings of the Annual Conference New Zealand Association of Economists and the Agricultural Economics Society (NZ Branch), 24-26 August 1992.</p>

<p>23 July 2009. At Robin's funeral we had a 'memory board' - a display of photos of Robin. Based largely on the same photos here is an <a href="http://users.actrix.co.nz/simonjohnson/p1/images.html">image gallery</a> for Robins webpage. It features images of Robin on mountaineering trips in the Southern Alps from  the late 1940s to early 1950s.</p>
<p>18 July 2009. Today is the first anniversary of Robin's death. I marked the day by walking from Karori West via Makara Road and Johnston's Hill to Mt Kaukau, along the ridges just west of Karori, Wilton, Chartwell and Ngaio. Although I had not walked to Mt Kaukau for at least fifteen years, Robin and I had walked from Mt Kaukau many times.</p> <p>The overcast weather cleared as I walked and the afternoon became fine and warm until the final gentle climb to Mt Kaukau when the sun was low over the Tasman Sea. There was no wind and no movement of the Makara 'West Wind' turbines. The Ohariu valley farmland was a gleaming shade of green in the low winter sun.</p> <p>When Robin and I first walked from Mt Kaukau to Johnston's Hill, in the 1970s, the walk was an informal route mostly over private farmland. Now, Wellington City Council has negotiated formal access for both walkers and mountain bikes, the route is sign-posted as are the ways off the main route to the suburbs, and it has a name. "the Skyline". Robin just used to call the walk 'Mt Kaukau to Johnston's Hill'.</p> <p>I left home in Allington Road at 11:30am, started 'the Skyline' route at 11:45am at Makara Road, and reached Mt Kaukau at 3:15pm. I walked down to Nairnville Park (Cockayne Road) and caught a No 44 bus to the Railway Station then a No 3 bus back to Karori.</p>
