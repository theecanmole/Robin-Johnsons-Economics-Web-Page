<h1>Foreshore and seabed property rights and resource use</h1>

<h5>Theory</h5>

<ol>
<li> Setting the rules for the rational and fair access to 
economic resources.</li>
<li> Commerce flows from a set of well-designed property rights.</li> 
<li> Should they be set in some abstract far-off world of reason 
or ground out in a maelstrom of debate and controversy?</li></ol>

<h5>Background</h5> 

<p>Debate about property rights to the 
foreshore and seabed land margins 
erupted in 2003 following a High Court 
decision to allow maori to take perceived 
access issues to the maori land court.</p><p>


At the heart of the debate is the issue 
whether the early administrative 
arrangements for land ownership 
following annexation of New Zealand in 1840 
sufficiently allowed for customary 
rights?</p><p>


The Treaty of Waitangi established among 
other things that maori would retain 
'full exclusive and undisturbed posession 
of their lands and estates forests 
fisheries and such other properties as they 
may collectively or individually posess, 
so long as it is their wish and desire to 
retain the same in their posession'.</p><p>

Governor Grey brought the Torrens 
system of land registration with him from 
South Australia in the 1840s. Registered 
land title was open to all races and 
further legislation protected the rights 
of Maori over subsequent years ( e.g. the 
Maori land court etc).</p><p>


The foreshore and seabed ownership was 
never clearly defined and successive 
legislators came to assume that all Maori 
rights were extinguished. it was this issue 
which came before the High Court and 
Court of Appeal in 2003 in a case concerning 
the Marlborough tribes' access to 
aquaculture sites in Marlborough Sounds.</p><p>


The Court of Appeal confirmed a High 
Court ruling that Maori common law 
rights in the foreshore and seabed have 
never been extinguished and that the 
Maori Land Court was able to declare such 
land to be customary land. land below the 
low water mark was deemed to be clearly 
owned by the Crown due to the particular 
statutes concerned.</p><p>

In response, the government drafted 
legislation which nationalised the 
foreshore and seabed in the interests of 
all New Zealanders  with regard to access 
and existing rights.  Provision was to be 
made for Maori to have access to the 
courts to establish continuous customary 
use of particular sites.</p><p>

<h5>Aboriginal rights in Australia</h5>

In the 1992 <i>Mabo</i> case the High Court of 
Australia said that the Meriam people had 
the right to posess their land on Mer 
Island in the Torres Strait according to 
their traditional law and custom.</p><p>

Australian law, for the first time, said 
that Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander 
people have rights to their country, 
according to their traditional laws and 
customs.</p><p>

These rights may be recognised when 
people have maintained a continuing 
connection with their land and waters and 
their rights have not been removed by 
government.</p><p>

Native title is the name given to the rights 
of these people and is a unique form of 
land title, different from freehold or 
leashold titles. Native title cannot be 
bought or sold.</p><p>

Native title is not a land right that 
government gives to indigenous people. It 
is a right that already exists in places 
where indigenous people follow their 
traditional laws and customs and have a 
continuing connection to their land and 
waters.</p><p>

<h5>Implications for resources</h5>

<ol>
<li>The common law approach identified 
that the area between high and low 
water marks was originally acquired by 
the Crown under the Treaty along with 
any pre-existing Maori customary 
property rights. These rights have never 
been extinguished.</li> 

<li>The vast majority of New Zealand land 
was converted to a fee simple basis thus 
extinguishing any customary rights. As for 
land below the high water mark, there 
was a general supposition before the 
Marlborough Sounds decision that any 
customary rights in that zone had been 
extinguished when the customary rights 
to the contiguous dry land were 
extinguished. That supposition was 
bolstered  by a belief in many quarters  
(including influential  judicial and legal 
quarters)  that the Crown owned the 
foreshore  and seabed anyway as  part of 
its prerogative right.</li> 

<li>The judges considered the application in 
New Zealand of the common law doctrine 
of aboriginal title. Aboriginal title is a 
mechanism to preserve the pre-existing 
rights of indigenous people under their 
own laws. It is judge made law.   In Australia, Aboriginal rights are A
based on continuity of customary 
property rights  upon the Crown's 
acquisition of sovereignty.</li>


<li>So the judges in this case merely decided 
that the Maoris had a right to establish 
before the courts exactly what 
customary rights remained.</li>


<li>From a resource use point of view this 
changed very little. The property right 
still had to be re-established. Resource 
use (in the form of exploitation of fishing 
or acqaculture resources) cannot 
proceed without first determining what 
the right is.</li> 


<li>From a property rights point of view the 
necessary conditions for exploitation 
involve exclusivity and transferability. 
The steps to establishing these conditions 
have not yet been taken.</li>


<li>Exclusivity would mean giving right 
holders sole control over use of that 
right. Transferability would mean that 
the right could be transferred to others 
possibly in some market transaction.</li>



<li>Any solution must address the issue of 
multiplicity and ranking of competing and 
non-competing rights. Can ownership be 
separated from use? Can access  be granted 
without prejudicing either ownership or 
use?</li>


<li>Expert witness Paul McHugh talks of a 
bundle of rights. McHugh postulated that 
Crown title to the foreshore did not mean 
that the Crown was recognised as having 
rights equivalent to full ownership – 
access, rights of fishing, navigation and 
innocent passge were recognised in 
common law.  The result is that the 
Crown's rights in the foreshore and 
seabed, at common law, amounted to a 
'bundle of rights' less than full 
ownership. This, it was argued, would lead 
in turn to the Crown not being in the 
position to grant anyone else full 
ownership in this view.</li>

<li>The result of this line of argument is 
that no one has developed a theory of 
multiple rights for the foreshore and 
seabed where the different claims can be 
accommodated in some total construct.</li> 

<li>In effect, government legislation to 
nationalise the foreshore and seabed 
achieves a new ownership structure with 
the question of multiple access rights 
within it still unresolved.</li></ol>

<h5>Questions</h5>

<p>Are customary property rights outside current property law structures? <p></p>

Will it take revolution and not evolution to changes these structures?<p></p>

Is this a question of profound constitutional change and to be judged in 
that context?<p></p>

According to Judge Wickliffe of the Maori 
Land Court "it is time to renegotiate the 
unwritten constitution of Aotea/New 
Zealand within the framework of the 
Treaty of Waitangi, so that government 
institutions can be realigned and 
legitimated".<p></p>


So, what follows?<p></p>
