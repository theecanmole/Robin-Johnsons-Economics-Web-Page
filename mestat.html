<a href="rwmj2000a.html">Recent Trends in New Zealand Agricultural Productivity</a>, 
with Rod Forbes. This 20-page paper reports a time series analysis of agricultural
productivity trends in NZ 1972-98. Tornqvist indexes of gross and
net output, and intermediate inputs in combination with actual
labour force and capital stock data are used to estimate total and
factor productivity in the agricultural sector. In the period
covered, total factor productivity increased by 4% per annum.</li>

agriculture?</a> This seven-page, unpublished paper is a reworked
and updated version of the 1972 paper (Efficiency Growth in New
Zealand Agriculture: a Review, <i>Economic Record</i>, 48(2),
76-91) in which elasticities of substitution between inputs in a
constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function are
estimated. The measurement of these elasticities is constrained by
deficiencies in the data sets, particularly a lack of variation in
the aggregate data series for inputs, ie capital and labour.</li>

The 2002 Conference of the NZ Assn of Economists had as its theme Raising NZ
in the OECD Growth Tables. This paper reviews B. P. Philpott's work
in this area and compares it with later work by Diewert and
Lawrence (1999). Philpott put massive investment into growth
statistics and used simple Solow-type models for his analytical
work. This paper shows that his results were affected by
deficiencies in the data base but nevertheless compare quite well
with later more sophisticated models using chain linked series
developed by Diewert and Lawrence. The paper includes a discussion
of the role of new investment and of Research and Development in explaining the
residual on a sectoral basis.</li>

<li><a href="rwmj2002c.html">Recent Trends in Dairy Farm Productivity</a>. 
Paper presented at Annual Conference of the NZ Agricultural and Resource Economics Society
2002 with Ann Anderson. This paper uses Tornqvist index numbers to
estimate total farm productivity trends in NZ for the period
1991-2001. The sample is divided into owner operator farms and
50/50 sharefarmers (the value of milk sales is divided equally
between the land owner and the herd owner). The early 1990s were a
period of rebuilding in the industry and real inputs exceeded real
outputs. Since 1996 the reverse has been true and total
productivity has increased by 3-4% per year.</li>

This paper, delivered at the annual conference of the NZ 
Agricultural Economics Society in July 2004,
concerns real productivity trends in the sheep and beef production
sector in NZ. The analysis employs Divisia weighted index numbers
to estimate trends over the period 1987-2003 for total production,
total real inputs and total input productivity. The data is drawn
from the field survey of sheep and beef farms conducted by the
Economic Serive of Meat and Wool Innovation (MWI) organisation - a
public good quango in NZ. Results indicate fluctuations in
productivity increase - when investment is on the rise,
productivity temporarily falls and then recovers, as the effects
are realised.</li>

This paper, delivered to the NZ
Association of Economists in June 2004, is concerned with the
recently adopted industrial classification system introduced in NZ
in 2000. The system is coordinated with Australia and is called the
Australian New Zealand Standard Industry Classification (ANZSIC).
It applies to all GDP, GCF, and capital stock estimates and is
being introduced for industry employment statistics. The present
paper describes the new classification and discusses how well it
melds with previous estimates of the above macroeconomic statistics
produced by Statistics New Zealand. The paper gives sources for
consistent industry series for GDP, GCF and stocks for the period
1972-2003.</li>
