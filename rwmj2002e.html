<p>Dr R.W.M.(Robin) Johnson is a former senior policy analyst
in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Wellington, New Zealand. His
interests are agricultural policy, agricultural trade, and the conduct of
policy analysis in the bureaucracy.He has represented New Zealand at meetings
at the FAO of the United Nations and the OECD. He has also worked as a
consultant to FAO and the World Bank.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Veterinary public health covers a
very wide field of animal and human health, from diseases of wild animals to
final consumer products. Its ramifications extend to trade in live animals as
well as the management of disease. It has wide international implications in
animal quarantine, the setting of standards in food quality, and international
trade.</p>
<p>In the area of food quality, the
WHO/FAO initiative of creating a global standard setting body (<i>Codex Alimentarius</i>) has resulted in a
major advance in the harmonization of food quality standards. It may be noted,
however, that veterinary public health is a wider concept than just applied to
food products, as it also encompasses animal health, international movement of
animals, and resulting public health concerns.</p>

<p>Globally, a large set of resources is required to maintain and support worldwide animal and animal
product inspection systems. It has been shown that economies in the delivery of
these services can be achieved through point control inspection systems.</p>


<p>Maintaining animal and animal product food health quality involves a major interference with domestic and
international trade. There is a critical interface between government and
private enterprise within countries where regulations have been imposed and
conflicts have arisen. Command and control systems are still largely prevalent with opportunities for underlying
resentment to surface.</p>

<p> In international terms, governments face off against each other in using such non-tariff measures to protect domestic industry. The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures was a major
achievement of the Uruguay Round. Harmonization of regulations offers greater
opportunities for trade in animals and animal products between nations, though
minimum standards have to be maintained. Protection of domestic industry is
difficult to prove.</p>


<p>At the technical level, international co-operation in veterinary public health matters has been
encouraged by intergovernmental scientific co-ordination organizations such as
the <i>Organisation Epizooties International, Codex Alimentarius</i>, and the Food and Agriculture
Organisation. They have an enhanced role following the Agreement on Sanitary
and Phytosanitary Measures agreed by member countries of the WTO in 1994.</p>

<h2>1. The Food Safety/Public Health Paradigm</h2>
<p>There is a long history of concern for human health being affected by problems with the food we eat. This
article is particularly concerned with foods of animal origin. As animals are
mostly warm-blooded creatures like man, they share with man a propensity to
host many organisms which have deleterious effects on both species. They are
also subject to contagions among themselves, e.g., such as rinderpest. In
addition, because animal foods are derived from living tissues, they are
susceptible to problems of storage and spoilage. Finally, because animals eat
many things that humans can, the food cycle can be re-infected with agents that
cause animal or human disease and hence continue the cycle of bad food and
spoilage.</p>

<p>Given these facts, <i>public food safety</i> in this area has to
be seen as a holistic system that monitors and manages the production, feeding,
slaughter and inspection of farm animals and animal products from birth to
final consumption. Governments have put in place in the past, and will continue
to introduce in the future, appropriate public health and animal health
measures that monitor the current status of animal diseases, human pathogens,
feed contamination, and problems of food storage. All of these require mainly goveernment sponsored and organized
surveillance and inspection systems at some point.  </p>

<p>There is some ambiguity in the
literature about the nomenclature describing these systems. 
According to the OIE, <i>veterinary public health </i>includes
zoonoses, food hygiene, drug residues and the environment. An American expert
talks of <i>veterinary public health and preventative medicine</i>. A British author talks of <i>contemporary veterinary medicine</i>, but does not include food
inspection. British legislation was oriented to <i>quarantine</i> against disease in live animal imports, and food quality was a matter for <i>local health
authorities</i>. Since animal health is involved in this aspect of public
health, the term veterinary public health is adopted here.</p>

<p>This paper is concerned with <i>public policy for food and agriculture</i>,
with particular reference to animal health inspection. The following sections
will therefore traverse most of the subject matter of <i>veterinary public health</i>. The WHO definition of veterinary public
health is &quot;veterinary public health comprises all the community efforts
influencing and influenced by the veterinary medical arts and sciences applied
to the prevention of disease, protection of life, and promotion of the
well-being and efficiency of man&quot;, in its widest sense, as it applies to <i>monitoring and controlling food quality</i> in animal products entering the human food chain, and clarifying its role in
public policy for food and agriculture. Obviously, the subject must include any
veterinary, quarantine, or surveillance matter that affects the wholesomeness
of food products derived from the animal kingdom.</p>

<h2>2. Economics of Veterinary Public Health</h2> 

<p> Veterinary public health (v.p.h.) covers
a wide range of economic issues. In the first place, it is a public service
industry which provides animal and human health services to both producers,
processors and consumers. These services add to the value of final goods
produced at each stage of production. In a free market situation, extra
services would not be demanded unless costs could be recovered. However, v.p.h.
is not subject to free supply and demand because society requires that minimum
standards of &quot;quality&quot; be maintained in all goods derived from animal
products. Indeed, society operates to make such standards mandatory. The cost
therefore has to be borne by the buyer/consumer or by the taxpayer. </p>

<p>Secondly, &quot;quality&quot; is
very hard to define in goods derived from animals. In particular, as the
following discussion will reveal, quality consists of characteristics that
appeal to the senses (organoleptic) and characteristics that are hidden from
the consumer (toxins etc). Therefore, the consumer has to be protected from
what he/she cannot see.</p>

<p> Thirdly, animals and animal diseases are
not static. In general, both are characterized by very high mobility which
means that infectious agents are easily spread from animal to animal and from
country to country. In economic terms, infection is the ultimate externality -
it cannot be internalized in an animal, in a herd, or within a country without
adequate control mechanisms (e.g., veterinary practice, quarantine,
inspection). </p>

<p>Fourth, the means of control
cannot be selective. There can be no exceptions with disease. Thus, in economic
terms, hygiene restraints on production at all its stages must apply to
everybody - in effect they have to be sanctions administered by and enforced by
some central authority. Hence, hygiene controls are usually administered by
Governments, and from an early stage in history, by international co-operation
between the governments of different countries.</p>

<p> Fifth, very large organizational skills
are required at government level to maintain animal disease surveillance
(animal health), international trade in animals (animal quarantine), entry of
animal food products into human consumption (meat inspection and food
standards), and control of animal feeds (feed standards). These functions are
usually found in Ministries or Departments of Agriculture under various
differently named bureaux or sections.</p>

<h2>3. Origins of Disease </h2>

<p>The idea that diseases can be transmitted from one animal to another has its origins in antiquity. The Romans
believed that disease could be spread by airborne seeds or <i>animalculae</i>(not necessarily living) that were taken in through the nose and mouth. The Jewish Talmud describes demons as hiding &lsquo;everywhere&rsquo; - in
water, crumbs and air - implying contagiousness. The primitive Hindus
associated sick rats with human plague, the first suggestion of a <i>zoonosis</i>. The Veronan Fracastorius,
writing in the early 16th century, argued that diseases were transmitted by
minute, invisible, particles. Lancisi, physician to Pope Clement XI, freed Rome
from rinderpest by using a <i>slaughter policy</i> to prevent infection of unaffected animals.</p>
<p>The main advances in the identification of microbes as causes of infectious diseases occurred in the
19th century, although the concept of a living contagious agent, <i>contagium animatum</i>, was found in the
17th century. Edward Jenners development of a smallpox vaccine using cowpox
infective material, and early biological warfare conducted by American settlers
who gave blankets belonging to smallpox victims to Indians as presents,
implicitly recognized contagion.</p>

<p>Viruses were also discovered in
the late 19th century, although not actually &lsquo;seen&rsquo; until the invention of the
electron microscope in the 1930s. In 1892, Iwanowsky demonstrated that tobacco
mosaic could be transmitted by sap that had been filtered through bacteria-proof
filters. Beijerinck serially transmitted the disease using bacteria-free
filtrates, and coined the term <i>contagium vivum fluidum</i> to describe the infectious living agent. In 1898-99,
Loeffler and Frosch discovered the first animal virus, and in 1911, Rous
reported the first virus-induced transmissible tumour. Towards the end of the
19th century, the first arthropod carrier (a tick) of an infectious disease was
identified by Kilborne, Smith and Curtis, investigating Texas fever of cattle. </p>

<h2>3.1. Domestication and Distribution of Animals</h2>

<p> The dog, naturally a hunter, was the first animal to be domesticated over 14 000 years ago, says Thrusfield. Sheep and goats were domesticated by 9 000BC in the fertile Nile valley and were the
basis of early pastoral cultures. These societies were succeeded by cattle
cultures (4 000 BC) and by pigs. The
records demonstrate that animals had a religious as well as an economic
significance in early civilisations. A European wild ox (extinct) was essential
to the religion of the Sumerians who migrated throughout Asia, North Africa and
Europe in the third millennium BC taking their animals and their beliefs with
them. India is the largest cattle culture that remains. </p>
<p> Cattle cultures persist in North East
Africa: the result of interaction between the Ancient Egyptians and early
Nilotic (Bantu) tribes. Cattle still play an important part in these cultures;
they are food, companionship, and status, and religious symbols to the Suk and
Dinka tribes and many others. </p>

<p> Horse cultures came to succeed some
cattle cultures. The horse is represented in Iranian, Greek, and Celtic
pantheons. It has become a symbol of veterinary medicine in the form of a
centaur, of which, Chiron was considered to be the mythological founder of
Greek medicine.   style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>The Spanish introduced
cattle, sheep, pigs and goats to North America in the 16th century. Haired
sheep were introduced to Africa by European slave traders. The Spanish brought
turkeys to Europe from North America.   </p>


<h2>3.2. Early Strategies for Disease Prevention</h2>
<p> The initial domestication of animals
brought man into close contact with animals, and therefore with their diseases.
While primitive theories of disease prevailed, economic survival ensured that
primitive techniques of disease treatment evolved. Quarantine (derived from the
Italian word meaning &lsquo;forty&rsquo; - the traditional length, in days, of isolation in
the Middle Ages) and slaughter became preventative strategies. The importance
of the horse in military affairs led to the development of the profession of veterinarians. The bias towards horses
lasted until the early 20th century when equine veterinary medicine was still
considered to be a more respectable occupation than the care of other species! </p>

<p>There are records of animal
plagues going back to the time of Christ. Anthrax was known in Rome in AD500,
and foot-and-mouth disease in Italy in AD1400, and rinderpest in France in 1710-1714. Animal plagues, especially
those of cattle, became particularly common in Europe in the mid 18th century
with the introduction of rinderpest from Asia. Local outbreaks of disease were
thought to be the result of local eruptions of noxious air: the <i>miasma</i>. The miasma were thought to
originate from filth generated by man, rather than from natural sources. Again
the theory, imperfect as it was, led to a stable phase of husbandry  characterized by improvement of farm hygiene,
slaughter, and treatment as control techniques. When rinderpest entered England
from Holland in 1714, Thomas Bates, surgeon to  George I, advocated fumigation of buildings, slaughter and burning of affected  animals, and resting of contaminated pasture as typical tactics. Cattle owners were also  compensated for loss.</p>

<p> Half the cattle in France were destroyed
by rinderpest between 1710 and 1714. The disease occurred irregularly until
1750 when it again became a serious problem. Little was known about the
disease. This provided impetus for the establishment of the first permanent
veterinary school at Lyons in 1762. Alfort was founded in 1766, Hannover in 1778,
London in 1791, Edinburgh in 1823, and Toulouse in 1825. </p>

<p>The lifting of <i>animal importation</i> restrictions in
England in 1840-42 increased the risk of disease occurring in Britain. Sheep
pox entered Britain in 1847 from Germany, and pleuropneumonia became a serious problem. Public concern, highlighted by the
rinderpest outbreak of 1865, was responsible for the establishment of the
British State Veterinary Service in the same year. Similar services were
founded in other countries. Disease control had become a public policy matter.</p>
<p>A new era dawned with the
discovery of the microbial basis of disease in the late 19th century. This
postulated a specific single cause of an infectious disease and therefore
implied a suitable control strategy directed against the causal agent.
Treatment of disease could be based on laboratory analysis involving isolation
of agents and identification of lesions followed by therapy. Control of disease
by prevention and, subsequently, eradication involved <i>mass testing</i> of animals and immunisation when an increasing number of vaccines became available. The discovery of disease vectors facilitated
disease prevention by <i>vector control</i> (e.g., malarial mosquito). An improved understanding of infectious agents life histories enabled their life cycles to be broken by manipulating the
environment: the draining of land to prevent fascioliasis (liver fluke) is a
good example. Bacterial diseases remained as major clinical problems until the
discovery and synthesis of antibiotics in the 20th century, which increased the
therapeutic power of the veterinarian. </p>

<h2>3.3. Animals as Food Sources</h2>
<p>Man has cultivated animals not
only for food sources but also for purposes of transport and war. In primitive
societies, food derived from animals did not lend itself to storage. It is
recorded that salt was a highly sought after commodity in early times because
of its capacity to preserve the flesh of animals. The domestication of animals
was thus marked by consistent patterns of feast and famine according to the
availability of fresh meat.</p>
<p> The disposal of animal carcasses was a
major problem in medieval society. Disposal of offal after slaughter went into
open trenches and dead animals were sent to knackers yards. Knackers sold the
skins of the animals and disposed of the carcasses in the field for birds and
scavengers to dispose of. Knackers were segregated from normal society and even
had their own cups in inns. There were some enlightened people who identified
these problems early in the 19th century (see Box 1). It was later recognized
that anthrax, a highly contagious disease of cattle, was spread from dead
material. Cholera was also thought to be spread from such sites in the middle
of the 19th century. </p>

<div class="c5"><p class="center"><b>Box 1. Goethe and Veterinary Public Health</b></p>

<p>&quot;The great poet Johann Wolfgang Goethe exercised the function of Minister of State under Grand
Duke Carl August of Sachen-Weimar-Eisenach, founding a small veterinary school
at Jena, in 1816, which operated for 30 years. In December 1831, a few months
before his death, Goethe issued instructions to those in charge of the Jena
Veterinary School to the effect that special attention should be paid to the
burial of anatomical specimens, to ensure that the trenches and gardens of the
school do not become overfilled, and were filled in promptly to be replaced by
a new burial place. From the instructions contained in the manuscript and from
his tribute paid to the personnel of
this institution in a Jena newspaper, one can see how the poet was concerned
about hygiene problems and carcass disposal in his capacity as an official in a
small principality.&quot;</p> 
<p>From Schonherr, W. (1991), History of veterinary public health in Europe in the 19th
Century, <i>OIE Revue Scientifique et Technique</i> 10 (4), 985-994.</p></div>

<p>The Smithfield market was in existence in 1253. In 1326,
Edward III granted by charter, to the citizens (and Corporation) of London, <i>exclusive</i> market rights and privileges
within seven miles from the city. There are records of an Urban Sanitary Act in
Britain as early as 1388. There had
been trade guilds in Britain, including butchers, since the 8th century. In
Scotland, they were called Fleshers Guilds and were incorporated before 1488. In
Aberdeen, the records of the city state that in 1399, four <i>appreciatores carnium</i>(meat inspectors) were appointed to examine
the quality of the flesh sold in the town. There is a clear pattern of
legislation in Britain governing the control of plagues (particularly
rinderpest) going back to 1714. The main legislation governing adulteration of
food to protect consumers dates from 1875 - the Food and Drug Act. </p>

<p>Food preservation was very
rudimentary. Slaughter took place in the autumn when temperatures dropped.
There are records of ice houses on English estates in the 17th century, so this
means of preservation was known at that time. Ice-packed cool stores were in
common use before the advent of refrigeration. The liquefaction of gases by
Faraday and Lavoisier and the invention of compression machines (c. 1834)
enabled the commercial production of ice by 1855. The advent of refrigeration
completely revolutionized not only the food storage problem but also world
trade in temperate agricultural products of animal origin. For example, the
first shipment of refrigerated beef from the US to the UK took place in 1875. </p>



<h2>3.4. Control of Live Animals</h2>

<p>Another characteristic of animal
hygiene and food safety is that animals themselves are mobile and contribute to
re-infection. Given the medieval problems of storage, it was customary to
transport <i>live animals</i> to where they
were required. Thus, the diseases of animals, which were either fatal to
themselves, such as rinderpest, or a threat to humans, such as tuberculosis,
were easily spread from district to district and from country to country. Added
to this were the problems of the disposal of dead animals and effluent. </p>

<p> In the UK, George I authorized an
eradication program for rinderpest in 1714 which was very successful. In 1746,
an Order in Council was introduced which authorized quarantine measures and
eradication after a further infection of rinderpest was discovered. In 1770, an
Order in Council banned imports of cattle. This was relaxed in 1840 or 1842
(according to which authority you quote) and imports of live animals resumed.
Further controls were imposed in 1847, 1848,
1857, and in 1865 the Cattle Disease Prevention Act covering quarantine
requirements, notification requirements, and a veterinary establishment act was
passed. A Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act was passed in 1869, which, with subsequent
amendments formed the basis of modern legislation in the UK.</p>
<p> In the United States, the Massachusetts
legislature authorised eradication of pleuropneumonia in 1859. The Bureau of
Animal Husbandry was established in 1884. In 1887, authority was given to
purchase and destroy cattle infected with, or exposed to, pleuropneumonia. In
1890, importation of diseased animals was prohibited and others quarantined.  </p>

<h2>4. The Development of Hygiene Inspection </h2>

<p>In Europe, scientific and
technical knowledge in the late 19th century enabled the association between
human tuberculosis and the consumption of beef infected with the tuberculosis
bacteria to be established. Pasteur was the first (in 1870) to suspect microbes
to be the agents of disease, and Gerlach (in 1875) described bovine &quot;pearl
disease&quot; and suggested it might be transmissible to humans. When the agent
of tuberculosis was discovered in 1882 by Koch, a causal relationship was
assumed to exist for the first time. Ten years later, in 1892, having confirmed
that tuberculosis could be transmitted to man by infected beef, Ostertag was
appointed to the first academic chair established anywhere in the world to
cover the fields of <i>meat inspection</i>
and <i>milk hygiene</i> at the University of
Berlin. Under his authorship, the first Meat Inspection Act in the world was
drawn up in 1900, following the promulgation of the first Epizootics Act in
1880.</p>

<p>Brucellosis or contagious
abortion of cattle was discovered by Bang in 1896. Infected animals may harbour
the agent in all organs and tissues, including the placenta and the mammary
glands. Man can be infected through contact with infected animals or through
the consumption of milk. Pasteurisation is an effective preventative measure.
Trichinellosis in pigs was discovered by Paget in 1835, but was not recognized
as a serious health problem until 1860 when Zenker, Virchow and Leuckart made
discoveries clearly demonstrating the life-cycle, transmission and
pathogenicity of the parasite. As a result of these discoveries, <i>obligatory inspection</i> of pork for the
presence of <i>trichinae</i> was introduced
in Prussia in 1877.</p>

<p>Rabies is a disease of the canine
family, which can be passed to man - usually by the dogs bite. Its prevalence
has declined in the 20th century due to unknown causes. The incidence of rabies
in man can be controlled by prophylactic vaccination and post-exposure
treatment, by reducing the risk of human exposure and, conclusively, by disease
elimination. </p>

<p>Latent infection is another
problem area - latent infection is where animals and animal stocks do not show
sign of infection in their lifetime and appear healthy on gross inspection. In
the case of <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria, for
example, feeds, excrement and ground water become contaminated with agents of
infection and they may be passed on to humans unknowingly. This raises the case
for government intervention to protect the consumer from what he/she cannot
see. Testing for <i>Salmonella, Campylobacter, Toxoplasma</i>, and other latent organisms is now the basis of
all modern inspection systems with public health implications [see Box 2].</p>

<h2>4.1. Contamination of Foods of Animal Origin</h2>

<p> Chemical residues may be present in
animals and may result in the contamination of food. Chemical residues may also
belong to quite different chemical substance groups. There are different routes
of contamination which may support one another. Contamination may result from
either deliberate legal or illegal use
of chemical substances or from substances present in the environment. Examples of the first type can be seen in
the use of veterinary medicines and
pesticides; examples of the second, in the use prohibited substances such as
hormonal growth promoters; examples of the third, in the presence of heavy
metals or chlorinated hydrocarbons from a contaminated environment. </p>

<h2>4.2. Methods to Guarantee Hygiene in Foods of Animal Origin </h2>

<p>Von Ostertag advocated passage of
the first Meat Inspection Act in Germany in 1900. It was characteristic that the
tasks involved were officially conferred on veterinarians who had the necessary
expertise through their professional training. They were also empowered to
decide on the acceptance of animals for slaughter (permission, ban, or
permission with certain restrictions) and to evaluate the fitness of meat for
consumption. These regulations, which essentially still apply today, served as
a model for many governments when passing their own rules for inspection.</p>

<p>The mode of examination has been
modified over the years but was always based on adequate <i>ante-mortem</i> and <i>post-mortem</i>
inspection. Initially, the primary objective was the detection of infectious
diseases (intensive clinical and/or pathological examination, bacterial
examination of meat, detection of trichinae), whereas more recently attention
has focused on the establishment of evidence of illegal methods of fattening,
the detection of residues of medicines and environmental chemicals (residue
analysis), and the damage caused by storage and transportation (lung
manifestations, abscesses, bone fractures, mastitis).</p>

<p>In view of the greater mechanisation and acceleration of the slaughtering process, it has become
increasingly difficult to provide for proper examination on the processing
line. Methods to achieve this are discussed later [HACCP]. It has also become
necessary to extend the anti-mortem inspection procedures back to the farm
level to ensure adequate hygiene among the animal stocks themselves.</p>
<p>With the development of consumer products in the meat industry and the advent of modern packaging materials,
backed by inspection systems, very high standards of hygiene can be
achieved. Such standards safeguard the
integrity of food in terms of consumer health and help promote uniform
conditions of hygiene within and between countries. Measures of standardisation
are now agreed by national, regional, and international bodies concerned with
hygiene.</p>

<p>With the development of inspection procedures, considerable improvements have also taken place in the
technology of slaughter, treatment, processing and preservation. Examples are
the use of heat treatment to aid preservation (milk) and to sterilize
by-products (blood), pasteurisation (liquid egg), heat treatment in canning,
efficient cooling chains (slaughter, transport and storage), and deep freezing
(poultry, fish and crustaceans). There is considerable international debate on
the adequacy of these technologies.</p>

<h2>4.3. Food Establishments</h2>
<p> To avoid the contamination of originally
uncontaminated foods, there is a need to extend controls to all food
establishments as part of proper application of good manufacturing practice. At
this end of the food chain, there is a need for co-operation between government
and private interests. The principal objective should be to identify those
phases in processing and handling which are critical with regard to hygiene,
and to eliminate sources of contamination. The resulting network of controls
should cover the entire path from primary production to the final product which
is ready for consumption. In many countries, these responsibilities are split
between different jurisdictions and are not harmonized adequately, if at all.  </p>

<h2>4.4. Animal Wastes</h2>

<p> The safe disposal and productive
utilization of animal wastes can make a major contribution to environmental
hygiene. The volume of waste material, eighty percent of which consists of by-products from slaughter, can be passed on
to rendering plants, to special industries which process it, and into sewage
systems. The technological processes employed must be designed in such a way as
to ensure adequate sterilisation, i.e., the elimination of agents of infection.
For example, German legislation on the disposal of animal carcasses requires
heating to 133 degrees celsius for 20 minutes and for processes to be organized
so that no cross-contamination can take place. Some countries require
pre-treatment of sewage materials. </p>

<h2>4.5. The Aims of Inspection in Slaughter of Animals</h2 

<p> This discussion suggests that there is a
very wide field of potential problems in monitoring and managing the food chain
in products derived from domestic animals. Not only must meat and other
products be free from disease, they must also meet other criteria to pass
inspection, such as appearance, smell and sight (organoleptic tests), religious
preferences, and methods of slaughter [see Box 3]. They must be processed in
facilities free of contamination and not be subject to consequent
re-contamination.</p>

<h2>5. Country Experience</h2>
<h2>5.1. Great Britain</h2>

<p> The control of meat inspection traditionally lay in the hands of city corporations. The corporations
represented the ruling classes and the guilds represented the slaughter
tradesmen and agreed rules evolved for the management of slaughtering premises
and the disposal of carcasses. Some corporations moved to license private
slaughterhouses while others built their own facilities and discouraged private
slaughterhouses. Leighton and Douglas record that the town of Cardiff, under
the Cardiff Corporation Act 1835, made private slaughterhouses illegal. The
making of regulations for the licensing, registering, and inspection of
slaughterhouses dates from the Towns Improvement Clauses Act 1847, and were
incorporated in later public health acts. Leighton and Douglas state that the
exposure for sale of unsound food has <q>always been an offence at common law.</q></p>
<p>Various Acts in England and Scotland, both public and private, have contained provisions relating to the making of
regulations for meat inspection; these are the Public Health Act 1875, the
Public Health Acts Amendment Act 1890, with regard to England in general, the
Public Health (London) Act 1891 with regard to the metropolis, and the Public
Health (Scotland) Act, 1897, in regard to Scotland. Such regulations were to
prevent cruelty, keep premises clean, provide for removing filth, supplying
water, and provide for the imposition of penalties. Inspection by a veterinary
surgeon was mandatory in Scotland but not in England. In 1908, in Edinburgh,
the inspection of butcher's meat and other foodstuffs was made under the Public Health (Scotland) Act 1897, section 43, and the staff consisted of four qualified veterinary surgeons who reported to
the Medical Officer of Health.</p>
<p>As a result of the <i>The Jungle</i> affair (see next section),
the Public Health (Regulations as to Food) Act 1907 was introduced empowering
local authorities through their officers to examine meat as it arrives at
ports. The regulations were designed to control the import of boneless meat and
similar products, carcasses of pigs from which the lymphatic glands are absent
(thus avoiding detection of tuberculosis), and to introduce the requirement for
<i>an official certificate of origin</i>
which shows that it has been passed at the <i>time
of slaughter</i>. Duties of inspectors at Liverpool under the Diseases of
Animals Act required them to inspect cattle steamers, both foreign and
cross-channel, with reference to fittings, ventilation, and <i>general hygiene conditions</i>. </p>
<p>When the UK entered the Common
Market in 1973, it became subject to the Veterinary Directives of the [now]
European Community. The EU adopted new welfare at slaughter rules in 1993
(Directive 93/119/EC) and these are reflected in the Welfare of Animals
(Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995. These made it an absolute offence to
cause or permit an animal avoidable excitement, pain or suffering; provided
specific rules on handling, stunning, slaughter or killing of animals; provided
that persons carrying out these tasks must have the knowledge and skill to do
their jobs humanely and efficiently; and must be competent and hold a registered
licence; and that every slaughterhouse must have a competent person with
authority to take action to safeguard welfare. The Meat Hygiene Service was
launched on 1 April 1995, and it took over from 300 <i>local authorities</i> responsibility for enforcing meat hygiene,
inspection and animal welfare and slaughter legislation for 1875 licensed fresh
meat premises in England, Scotland and Wales. Public health and welfare are
safeguarded in plants by Official Veterinary Surgeons and Meat Inspectors.</p>

<h2>5.2. United States  </h2>

<p>In the United States, European countries were complaining that American meats were unwholesome as early as the
1870s. In 1878, the UK placed restrictions on the importation of US cattle for
slaughter because of the presence of bovine pleuropneumonia and ordered that
all such cattle must be slaughtered at the port of landing within 10 days.
Italy and Hungary in 1879, followed by Germany, Spain, France, Turkey, Rumania
and Greece, banned the import of pork from the US because of the presence of <i>trichinae</i>.</p>

<p> In the decade prior to 1891, amid large
meat export losses, meat packers and livestock producers approached Congress
for remedial action. In 1889, the secretary of agriculture had noted the need
for a national program of livestock inspection of cattle at the time of
slaughter that would result in the condemnation of carcasses unfit for food and
guarantee the accepted product as untainted by disease. Congress responded by
passing the first federal meat inspection law, which was signed by the president
on 30 August 1890. The act provided only for the inspection of live animals for
export, and inspection by the piece of intended meats for export, primarily
salted pork and bacon. There was no determination of the health of the animals
prior to slaughter. Due to the inadequacies of the law, foreign governments
refused to recognize certificates issued under it and continued to exclude US meats.</p>

<p>On 3 March 1891, a second law was
passed requiring <i>ante-mortem</i> inspection of cattle, hogs and sheep whose meat was intended for export or sale
across state lines and authorising <i>post-mortem</i>
inspection at the discretion of the secretary of agriculture. Inspection
responsibilities were placed under the US Department of Agriculture, Bureau of
Animal Industry, an agency created in 1884 to deal with the control and
eradication of bovine pleuropneumonia. The federal meat inspection program was
inaugurated on 12 May 1891 at Eastman and Co. abattoir, New York City, on
cattle for export. In June 1891, inspection began in Chicago and other
mid-western plants. Inspection first consisted of ante-mortem examinations and
permissive post-mortem examinations, and was later extended to include
microscopic examinations of pork for trichinae to meet German requirements. By
1893, microscopists were being used in Kansas plants. Further law changes in
1895 established better controls for carcasses and parts of carcasses condemned
as a result of inspection procedures. State and municipal authorities were
responsible for the destruction of condemned animals.</p>

<p>As a result of considerable further public outcry, as well as the result of the publication of Upton
Sinclairs book about the Chicago meat works, <i>The Jungle</i>, the 1906 Meat Inspection Act was passed by Congress.
The act provided for mandatory <i>post-mortem</i> inspection of all cattle, sheep, swine, and goats whose meat was to be sold
interstate or in foreign commerce; for the destruction of all carcasses found
to be unfit for human food; and for control over processing and labeling of
foods derived from inspected and passed carcasses. It provided authority for
the secretary of agriculture to draw up regulations governing sanitation in the
packinghouse. Mandatory ante-mortem inspection was not provided for, but in practice was done under the discretionary
authority granted to the secretary.</p>

<p>In 1907, legislation was passed providing for labeling reviews, for inspection of live horses; and for
separation of diseased animals from other animals, and of slaughter areas from
processing areas. In 1942, to meet the food emergencies of World War II,
Congress enacted a law temporarily applying the provisions of the Meat
Inspection Act to all meat plants involved in intrastate commerce. This law was
repealed in 1947. In 1958, the national Humane Slaughter Act set standards for
the equipment and methods used in slaughtering food animals to ensure the
humane treatment of these animals. Finally, the Wholesome Meat Act 1967 was
passed by congress, and all meat for sale had to pass inspection; inspection
programs in states had to be equal to federal programs; transporters and
cold-storage warehouses were made subject to the provisions; and requirements
covering imported meats were made more stringent so that these products would
be <i>inspected by foreign programs</i> at least
equal to the United States.</p>

<h2>5.2.1. Poultry (US)</h2>

<p>At the time that the Meat Inspection Act 1906 was passed, there was no generally perceived need to
include poultry and poultry products in the provisions of the act. It was not
until the 1940s that poultry slaughter and processing reached the size and
concentration that the need for regulatory supervision became evident. Three
separate sets of regulations and eight different standards and grades for
poultry were consolidated, revised, and published in the <i>Federal Register</i> on 15 November 1949 under the title
&quot;Regulations Governing the Grading and Inspection of Poultry and Domestic
Rabbits and Edible Products Thereof and United States Specifications&quot;. The
revised regulations became effective on 1 July 1951, and, for the first time,
sanitation requirements became applicable to federally-inspected poultry
dressing operations, and only poultry processed in compliance with these
requirements could be inspected. Additionally, grading and grade labeling of
ready-to-cook poultry were permitted only when the poultry had been inspected
for wholesomeness under the department inspection program or an official
inspection program approved by the department. Further legislation was passed
in August 1957, the poultry products Inspection Act, that provided for
mandatory inspection of all slaughtered poultry moving in interstate or foreign
commerce; responsibility for administration resting with the USDA, Agricultural
Marketing Service.</p>

<h2>5.3. Australia and New Zealand</h2>

<p>In the rest of the New World, Australia and New Zealand were also affected by changes in European import
requirements, as well as South America and elsewhere. The Australian export
trade in meat to the United Kingdom had its beginning when the worlds first freezing
works was built on Sydneys waterfront in 1861, giving impetus to the
establishment of formal inspection processes to satisfy overseas requirements
for the domestic sale of meat. After a failed attempt on the <i>Durham</i> in 1873, the first successful
cargo of frozen meat (and butter) arrived in London in 1880 on the <i>Strathleven.</i> The first frozen meat cargo
to leave New Zealand (in 1882) was on the sailing ship <i>Dunedin</i>. The ship took 98 days to reach England!</p>

<p>Records of early meat inspection
procedures in Australia are sparse, but clearly, even by the early 1890s they
were inadequate, as UK authorities complained of numerous <i>onchocerca</i> nodules left in beef briskets, and rejected some
shipments of forequarter beef. As a result of overseas concern, the Commonwealth
Government invoked its constitutional powers and appointed a veterinary officer
to supervise inspection of export beef in Queensland. This was later extended
to cover all states of Australia. In 1916, the Commonwealth Government expanded
its role by establishing an inspection service of meat inspectors under
Commonwealth jurisdiction. Primary inspection was carried out by meat
inspectors with veterinarians advising and having overall responsibility.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, a Department of Agriculture was established
in 1890 with J.A. Gilruth as Chief Veterinary Officer (later Professor of
Veterinary Pathology at the University of Melbourne). In response to an
outbreak of tuberculosis in dairy herds, the Slaughtering and Inspection Act
1890 was passed, which legislated for the compulsory inspection of meat for
export, and established the first meat inspection service under Gilruth with
supervising veterinarians and meat inspectors. The Act provided for all
slaughtering of meat to be inspected, stock inspections to be carried out on
farms and diseased stock destroyed, and compensation paid. Gilruth arranged for
shipments of previously un-sterilised bone dust from Calcutta and Sydney (it
was a carrier of anthrax) to be sterilised at port of dispatch, and also organized
(at a place called Wallaceville) the first veterinary research laboratory in
New Zealand. Most of the New Zealand export of meat was landed in the Port of
London. </p>

<p>Inspection systems in both
Australia and New Zealand were geared to the import requirements of the UK
government. From 1908, this was controlled by the Public Health (Regulations as
to Food) Act 1907 which resulted in port inspection by local authority
officials. Among other things, certificates of origin at the time of slaughter
were a mandatory requirement. The opening of the US market to imports of beef
in 1957, caused a huge change of alignment of inspection facilities and costs
in both countries. The Wholesome Meat Act 1967 subsequently laid down detailed
requirements and standards for meat slaughtering, processing and storage within
the United States and in those countries exporting meat to the US. A large
investment in processing facilities was required
of the processing companies to meet these requirements. In 1962, the UK entered
the Common market, and New Zealands lamb trade was particularly affected by the
application of the First Country Veterinary Directive, and later, the Third
Country Veterinary Directive, especially with regard to plant hygiene, stock
yards, and wall materials. These were modelled on continental systems of
inspection. New Zealand and Australia have
survived these impositions, and continue to trade with both the EU and the US. Australia
and New Zealand have followed US practice and have adopted HACCP in recent years.</p>
<h2>6. Process and Procedures </h2>

<p>Economists would say that the
imposition of necessary checks on
diseases of animals entering the human food chain have had high transaction
costs. By that they mean the time-honoured measures of quarantine, port
inspection, animal health and food quality have been expensive in terms of the
labour and administration resources involved. Such costs are met by taxpayers
or are deducted from farmers' returns.</p>

<p>As will be discussed below, the
need for greater efficiencies in these processes while still maintaining
quality standards have led to new systems of food inspection in many countries
(HACCP).</p>

<p>Inspection in
slaughterhouses/abattoirs has been particularly costly in terms of skilled and
lay employees. In most countries, supervision by qualified veterinarians is
required, while on-line [chain] inspection has been the work of well-trained
lay inspectors [It has to be remembered that every carcass has to inspected for
faults in a very fast moving industrial process]. </p>

<p>Quality requirements are
generally specified in manuals. These not only serve to guide abattoir
inspectors but also form the standard for imports of meat products across
international borders. Most countries provide <i>certificates</i> that accompany every shipment of a given meat product.
Some countries require that such certificates include specific clauses relating
to their own legislative requirements. International manuals might specify
conditions for the import of fresh and frozen meat and meat by-products,
including prohibitions and import restrictions, labeling requirements and
certification requirements (see Box 4).</p>

<p> As will be discussed below, these
requirements are a definite impediment to trade, but are thought to be
justified from the point of view of human health protection. </p>

<h2>6.1. The Move to Food Safety</h2>

<p>Traditional meat inspection has
tended to focus on organoleptic inspection and the removal of visual
pathological defects from the food chain (See Box 5). The true risk of these
defects in human health terms has not been quantified in the past, but is now
considered to be of far less importance than the microbiological contamination
by pathogens derived from the gastro-intestinal tract or the skin of the
animal, or from the operator, that occurs during the slaughter and dressing
process. This view of the process is widely accepted internationally and countries are moving steadily to conform with its
principles.</p>

<p>Formal process control and
quality assurance systems within the production chain are now being adopted
world-wide. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is one such system
and derives from a scientifically-based production and inspection system first
developed in the United States by NASA to ensure food safety for astronauts.
The HACCP concept was pioneered in the 1960s by the Pillsbury Company, the
United States Army and the United States National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), as a collaborative development for the production of
safe foods for the United States space program. NASA wanted a &quot;zero
defects&quot; program to guarantee the safety of the foods that the astronauts
would consume in space. Pillsbury therefore introduced and adopted HACCP as the
system that would provide the greatest safety while reducing dependence on <i>end-product inspection and testing</i>.HACCP focuses on preventative measures rather than end-products testing. Monitoring processes ensures food is produced
in the safest possible way and that all potential hazards (e.g.,
micro-organisms, chemical hazards and physical hazards) are either prevented or
reduced to negligible levels.</p>

</table>

<p>The reasons for, and the extent of, Governments involvement in meat inspection programmes internationally, is
historic, and meat inspection remains one of the only areas in the commercial
production of a commodity where governments intervene to the extent they do.
Fundamental questions have now arisen as to the necessity for and cost effectiveness
of the traditional organoleptic meat inspection program with all its <i>ante</i> and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>post mortem</i> inspection and hygiene verification being carried out
by government employees.</p>

<div class="c5">
<p class="center"><b>Box 5. Traditional Regulatory Approach</b></p>
<p><u>Regulatory Good Manufacturing Practice</u></p>

<p>Multitude of <q>regulatory</q> requirements based on
<q>veterinary</q> good manufacturing practice. These are existing standards and
procedures processors must comply with to get certification for market access.</p>

<p><u>Characteristics:</u></p>
<p>Meets existing market access requirements based on visible defects.</p>

<p>Does not deliver a consistent product in terms of microbiological loading therefore of unknown
pathogen load and unable to guarantee shelf life when saving vacuum packed
chilled product.</p>

<p>Microbiological loadings in range 10 to 100000 / sq cm.</p>

<p>Weak correlation between visible contamination rate detected at meat inspection and real microbiological loading. In some cases correlation is negative.</p>

<p>Unlikely to meet future market requirements where emphasis is on reduction of pathogens.</p>


<p>Approach is described as <q>command and control</q> and does not allow processors to take the primary
responsibility for the food safety of their production.</p></div>

<p>Consumers are becoming more
exacting and vocal in their demands for safe food. These demands come at a time
when many Governments' financial resources preclude adding further costs to the
food safety program. Within the US, Canada, and the EU, there is a move to
shift the primary responsibility for the safety of food to food processors, and
to improve the performance of programs by mandating that all processors design
food safety programs and process foodstuffs in accordance with specified
principles such as HACCP provides. There is thus a need to move away from
<q>command and control</q> methods towards performance-based standards using
pathogens as the indicator of performance (see Box 6). The outcome is reduced
inspectorial input for traditional inspection, but a greater dependence on
internal control processes. This enables regulatory costs to be contained, and
enhances commercial productivity.</p>

<p> It is accepted that the bulk of
pathological defects are of an aesthetic nature and have no impact on public
health. Governments are therefore beginning to view these defects as primarily
a commercial quality problem when compared with microbiological contamination
of gastro-intestinal / skin / operator origin. Government employed
veterinarians are giving way to government lay inspectors, and they in turn are
giving way to industry personnel carrying out the same function, under
government oversight and with technical support to a greater or lesser degree.  </p>

<p>Within the European Union,
various &quot;Food Directives&quot; have been promulgated, focusing on reduced
levels of all zoonotic pathogens. HACCP is included as a requirement within a
number of these Directives. In the US, the &quot;Mega reg&quot; proposal is
geared toward pathogen reduction and process control through the mandatory
application of HACCP. In Canada, Australia and New Zealand, HACCP is seen as a
means of ensuring that industries meet their responsibilities for food safety
and become less dependent on traditional process methods. </p>

<p>The concept of HACCP has been
promulgated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Recognizing the importance of
HACCP to food control, the 20th session of the Commission adopted <i>Guidelines for the Application of the Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Point system</i> in July 1993. FAO notes that the application of HACCP is compatible with the implementation of quality management systems, such as the ISO 9000 series, and
HACCP is the system of choice for the management of food safety within such
systems. FAO has published a full-scale training manual for HACCP.</p>

<h2>7. International Co-ordination</h2>

<p>The World Health Organisation
(WHO), based in Geneva, is the over-arching United Nations (UN) organisation
with responsibility for international co-ordination of human health matters.
Veterinary public health is the responsibility of the <i>Office International des Epizooties</i> (OIE) based in Paris which is an inter-governmental organisation outside the UN ambit, but which co-operates
with it. The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the UN has
responsibility for all matters of food and agricultural production, from the
production stage to marketing and hence also includes animal production and
animal food products. Finally, WHO and FAO established the Codex Alimentarius
Commission in 1962 to co-ordinate international matters concerning food
standards, including both animal and plant products. International co-operaclation
on health preceded international co-operation in trade. There are obviously
overlapping jurisdictions between these four organisations, which are
elucidated below.</p>

<div class="c5">

</div>

<p>The <i>Office International d'Hygiene Publique</i> (International Office of
Public Hygiene)(IOPH), a precursor of WHO, was founded in Paris in 1907. An
International Conference for the Study of Epizootics was held in Paris in 1920
at which it was proposed that surveillance and control of epizootics be part of
IOPH. However, the <i>Office International des Epizooties </i>(OIE) was established in 1924 as a separate
inter-governmental organisation.</p>

<p>The founders of OIE were mainly concerned with preventing devastating epizootics that could hamper world trade
in products of animal origin. They were also concerned that the link to human
health should not be overlooked. In the period since the creation of the WHO in
1948, the OIE has remained involved in veterinary public health issues,
including zoonose, food hygiene, drug residues and the environment, and has
encouraged international co-operation in zoonotic matters.</p>

<p>At the second
General Session in May 1928, the International Committee of the OIE recommended
measures for the control of zoonoses. Canine rabies was the first zoonosis to
be studied, and work on this disease has continued to the present time. In
1951, there was a world wide convention on rabies control. Brucellosis in
animals has also been a long lasting theme at the Sessions of the OIE. Among
other zoonoses given priority, in view of their human health consequences for
international trade in animals and animal products, were tuberculosis,
echinococcosis/hydatidosis, anthrax, Q fever, glanders, cysticercosis,
trichinellosis, psittacosis, and tularaemia. </p>

<p>Since 1930, the OIE Committee has
also dealt with questions of food hygiene, devoting some of its work to the
scrutiny of health certificates for meat and meat products. The Committee has
formulated recommendations on food poisoning, salmonellosis, trichinellosis and
listeriosis, as well as veterinary supervision of milk production, inspection
of food of animal origin, food additives, hormones and residues of veterinary
drugs. In March 1999, the OIE comprised 153 member countries, and listed its
main objectives are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>inform Governments of the occurrence and course of animal diseases throughout the
world, and of ways to control these diseases;</li>
<li>co-ordinate, at the international level, studies
devoted to the surveillance and control of animal diseases;</li>
<li>harmonize regulations for trade in animals and animal
products among member countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>International co-ordination of human health matters was taken over by WHO in 1948. The link to animal health
was consolidated by the establishment of a veterinary section in the Division
of Communicable Diseases of WHO in 1949. The experts suggest this date as the
beginning of the study of <i>veterinary public health</i> as a distinct field of study. WHO programs in this area have concentrated on the major zoonoses, milk, meat hygeine, comparative medicine,
and veterinary education. Much of the work in the early years was undertaken in
close co-operation with the FAO with its concern for the improvement of
agricultural production and methods of food production.</p>

<p>The FAO was established by the United Nations in 1944 at Hot Springs. It is the specialized UN agency dealing
with all aspects of food quality and safety throughout each of the stages of
food production, storage, transportation, processing and marketing. Work in
this area is carried out by the Food Quality and Standards Service of the FAO
Food and Nutrition Division. Activities include providing policy advice to
member countries; executing food quality control and safety development
projects, including the development of food standards and technical
regulations; food quality and safety assurance programmes for the food
industry; establishing national export food certification programmes;
monitoring programmes for food contaminants; and conducting regional and
national seminars and workshops on food control issues.</p>

<p><i>Codex Alimentarius</i> (Codex) is a code of food standards for all
nations. It was developed by an international commission established in 1962 by
the FAO and the WHO. Its establishment recognized the need for international standards to guide the world food
industry and to protect the health of consumers. Since it was established,
Codex has produced sets of standards, guidelines and principles on more than
219 food commodities and 35 hygienic and technological practice codes,
evaluations of 500 food additives and contaminants, and the setting of more
than 3000 maximum residue limits.</p>

<p>In the realm of animal products and veterinary drugs, there are Codex Committees on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods, Meat, Meat Hygiene, Processed Meat and Poultry Products, and Milk and
Milk Products. The Committees act as subsidiary bodies of the Codex
Alimentarius Commission as established by the FAO and the WHO in 1962.</p>

<h2>8. International Trade</h2>

<p>In devising rules for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, explicit recognition was made of
the need for countries to maintain sanitary and phytosanitary standards. While
the general aim was to encourage trade by the reduction of quantitative
restrictions and tariffs, it was recognized that domestic policy measures that
maintain human and animal health should be seen as <i>exceptions</i> to the new rules. Article XX provides:</p>
<p class="blocktext">Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in a manner which would
constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between
countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any
contracting party of measures:....(b) necessary to protect human, animal or
plant life or health;....(g) relating to the conservation of exhaustible
natural resources, if such measures are made effective in conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or
consumption ... (GATT 1986, pp.37-38).</p>

<p>Thus the GATT Articles recognize
that animal and human health measures are legitimate domestic policy
objectives, and also state that the same standards must apply to imports from
other countries as those that apply domestically. </p>

<p> In the Uruguay Round of the GATT, a common set of rules and disciplines was adopted to guide the application of
sanitary and phytosanitary measures (The Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures). In the language of international diplomacy, greater <q>transparency</q>
in measures was sought in the sense that countries could achieve a greater
understanding of other countries' problems and an acceptance of a set of common
standards. Greater international <q>harmonisation</q> of standards, rules and
procedures using the international scientific organisations would produce trade
benefits. Better frameworks for consultation and dispute settlement would also
assist. Acceptance of <q>equivalence</q>, whereby countries would be able to adopt
different measures providing they achieve the same objectives was sought.  </p>
<p>It is thus hypothesized that trading opportunities between countries can be improved if individual countries
can agree on a common set of rules for the conduct of trade. Rules provide
common reference points and assist arbitration between countries in cases of
conflict. At the same time, Article XX made clear that justifiable domestic
measures associated with <i>human and animal health</i> constituted a general exception to the original rules of the 1947 GATT. Policy makers should be alert, however, to any measures that are
introduced that are simply a disguised form of protection.</p>

<h2>8.1 Assessing the New Rules</h2>

<p>As the history of sanitary and phytosanitary policy measures demonstrates, there are now a myriad of country
regulations and acts governing live animal trade, quarantine, product
inspection, disposal, and presentation of animals and animal products. On the
one hand, these regulations serve to maintain animal and human health in the
respective countries. On the other hand, they also serve to prevent the
movement of tradable goods, especially where there is little ground for their
imposition, or the problem they were designed to meet no longer exists.</p>

<p>The main mechanism to deal with these matters is through the disputes procedures of the GATT (now the WTO). The
Agreement does specify that there must be a scientific justification for each
measure in dispute, and that the international science co-ordination bodies
(OIE, Codex, Plant Protection Convention) should be involved in the process.
Research of these issues is quite difficult and very little has been reported
in the international literature. Petrey and Johnson report a survey of Pacific
Basin Countries with regard to meat inspection procedures, and they state:</p>

<p class="blocktext">&ldquo;...these meat measures are historically
the result of bilateral negotiation between countries. To that extent, they are
fully transparent to the parties involved. The wider question, however, is
whether such measures are transparent in relation to the problem they seek to
contain? Is the underlying problem a true health risk or a form of non-tariff
protection? Detailed rules for assessment of health risk along the lines proposed in the Uruguay Round would
represent a significant advance in this direction.<br>

<p class="blocktext">From the data collected ... the following justifications for sanitary regulations in the meat
trade area can be identified: threats to animal health; threats to public
health; need for truth-in-labelling; meeting consumer aesthetics; maintenance of product quality; maintaining
security from tampering; meeting customary practice; protection of domestic
production; need for market discipline; and prevention of entry into the edible
food chain. <i>Within such a broad framework, case-by-case studies would be
required to identify the original motives for each domestic policy measure and
whether it was <q>justified</q> in WTO terms</i>.&rdquo;</p>
