<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="it">Since 1991, the New Zealand Government has allocated
public R&amp;D funds through a pool system - called the public good
research fund - through which research providers (universities,
research institutes etc) must bid for funding on a project by
project basis. This system was to counteract a previous tendency
for public funding through departmental structures to discourage
private sector investment - <q>crowding out</q>. The funding
administrators were enjoined to take account of the private
appropriability of the projects submitted and direct public funds
to complementary projects or projects which would otherwise be
under-funded. This paper finds evidence of increased private sector
participation in research funding, and a declining share going to
research provision over the last 9 years. The Crown Research
Institutes appear to be the main beneficiaries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The administrative reforms of research organisations in New
Zealand in the last fifteen years have been propelled by fiscal
conservatism on the part of the governments of the time and a
perception that publicly provided funds should be accounted for in
a more open and efficient way. In that framework, it was thought
that the dominance of public funding in the science sector had
tended to discourage private investment in research and development
- the so-called phenomena of <q>crowding-out</q> (Bollard <i>et
al</i> 1987, p.67;Jardine 1989, p.8). Part of the reform was
therefore to change the set of incentives that faced research
funders and providers in order to bring about greater
accountability, efficiency and private participation. It is now
fifteen years since the start of the reforms and
responses/reactions to the changes are starting to emerge. This
paper discusses the reasons behind the reforms as demonstrated in
government documents of the time and developments in funding and
provision since.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s government funded about half, business about
a third and the universities about a sixth of annual research
expenditure in New Zealand. Taking the public sector and the
universities together, public investment was 64 per cent of the
total funded and private investment 36 per cent. The pre-reform
organisation of public science providing activities was strongly
hierarchical and controlled and funded by central government. Prior
to the reforms, the Ministry of Agriculture (MAF) and the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) spent 73
per cent of the total government budget on science.</p>
<p>The 1980s reforms changed the funding basis of public research
as well as the organisational structures. Central government funds
were placed in a pool (the public good science fund) and made
available to all research providers through a bidding process - the
universities were included at a later stage of the reforms when
they could identify what they would contribute to the pool. The old
departmental structures were replaced by subject-based,
self-financed and governed research institutes, that would compete
with other providers for the public funds available, and seek
private funding as well.</p>
<p>In the aggregate, the share of funding carried by the public and
private sectors in the 1990s has not changed greatly - private
sector funding has risen to 40 per cent and the total public sector
funding has declined accordingly. But within these changes, there
has been a more pronounced shift in the conduct of research - the
private sector (which includes industry research associations) is
contracting out more of its research, mainly to the benefit of the
universities. Government provision of research (mainly the CRIs)
has increased marginally.</p>
<p>The post-reform response to the organisational and funding
reforms has therefore been a shift toward private sector funding
and direction of research (as envisaged by the planners) and a
contrary shift toward public conduct of research (including the
universities). Most significant has been the movement of new funds
into the university research sector - from government, from
university general funds, and from business. The flow of private
funds into the research institutes has also increased, thus
reducing their dependence on public funds from their previously
high levels. These changes suggest that private investment was
crowded out in earlier years, but closer investigation reveals that
the private sector was not positioned to carry out a greater role
in funding and conduct of research at the time.</p>
<p>This paper discusses the policy climate surrounding public fund
allocation during the reforms of the science sector in the late
1980s and early 1990s, and the trends in organisation, funding and
research provision that have emerged since.<a class="f" name=

<h2>2. The reform of public good research funding</h2>
<p>The public good science fund (PGSF) system pooled the available
government funds for research and development (R&amp;D) and
instituted a bidding process, administered by the Foundation for
Research, Science and Technology (FRST), in which research
providers competed for public sponsorship. <a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym" id=
"sdfootnote2anc">(2)</a></p>

<p>The newly formed crown research institutes (CRIs), other
providers, and later the universities, were able to draw on these
funds provided they met the administrative criteria for public good
research.</p>
<p>The administrative test is specified as <q>[investment in goods]
that may be of benefit to New Zealand, but are unlikely to be
funded, or adequately funded, from non-government sources</q>
(MoRST 1992b, p.16). This [assumes] that the reason for
under-investment is non-appropriability of the results. It is a
wide definition that could encompass any research where the
benefits are spread across a large number of beneficiaries and
cannot be captured at all by a single entity. The addition of a
test of <q>inadequate funding</q> suggests private <q>market
failure</q> as economists understand the term, and allows some
degree of compensation or subsidisation to be taken into account in
making grants.</p>
<p>The title of the fund was borrowed from economics but the
definition of public good science is fraught with difficulties in
practice. The main criteria appears to be whether under-investment
will result from the removal of public funds when it has been
identified that a proposed piece of research would be in the
national interest. This implies that a matrix of social benefits
can be identified that will reward the taxpayer in some way. The
award of contracts is actually decided not by some social
cost-benefit analysis but by the defining of a research agenda and
utilising the resulting rules accordingly (MoRST 1992b, p.78).
There are thus real difficulties in turning broad objectives into
practical rules for public good research funding and
allocation.</p>
<h6>The search for allocation rules</h6>

<p>The 1992 review of long term science priorities raised concerns
about the balance of research funding between research directly
impacting on economic performance, and research underpinning areas
on which economic activity depends indirectly (infrastructure
research, and the social and natural sciences)(MoRST 1992c, p.11).
The report noted that 68 per cent of PGSF funding in 1991-92 was
allocated to the directly `wealth creating' classes 1 to 19 (of the
first list of output classes). They stated that this class of
outputs was already well funded, but output classes 20 to 35 were
more difficult to assess because the benefits they create are less
direct and can be longer term. The report recommended a shift in
emphasis from both the natural sciences and the production groups
to what they called the infrastructural group (output areas 20 to
28). The implication is that underpinning research is more of a
public good than wealth creating research goods.</p>
<p>The report recommended a productive partnership between the
public and private sector to ensure successful commercialisation of
PGSF research results. It stated that PGSF research is more likely
to be successfully adopted if the research is planned with strong
user involvement and is likely to have the greatest chance of
producing benefits to New Zealand where users have well-established
market linkages and were performing their own research. The
implication here is that greater co-operation and co-ordination
between sectors would compensate for the low level of private
sector sponsorship of research (BERL 1995, p.46).</p>
<p>The 1992 report's authors believed there was an imbalance
between different output classes. They noted the low spending of
the private sector in primary production compared with primary
processing. This allocation of funds by the different providers has
been consistent through all the surveys conducted by the Ministry
of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST)(Table 1). Government
spending dominates in primary production and in environmental
research; `business' investment dominates in processing primary
products, manufacturing, construction, transport and energy; the
universities dominate in social science, health and fundamental
research. Since 1995-96, the private sector share as a whole has
not changed much but there has been a shift away from government to
the universities.</p>

<p>The report recommended that the PGSF should <i>complement</i>
successful private research activities where funds are used to
promote strategic and generic research and where there is a
demonstrated need for such research. Such complementarity should
not displace private research funding, the report states, or
support appropriable research. The panel therefore recommended that
using the PGSF to complement private funding <q>should be
conditional on a continuation or enhancement of funding from the
private sector</q>.</p>
<p>In the MoRST instructions to FRST dated July 1997, these
objectives do not appear to have changed (MoRST 1997b). The
Minister noted that the organisational gains made have resulted in
a strong focus on small-scale purchasing of outputs, over
relatively short time frames, and within a rather rigid framework
of rules and procedures. FRST needed to develop a strategic,
far-sighted, and pro-active strategy for focusing on the
achievement of outcomes. <q>It will be crucial to foster
interactive relationships....... in publicly funded organisations
and in the private sector, that together underpin a vibrant and
thriving knowledge-based society</q>. With respect to encouragement
of the private sector, <q>funding allocations should be managed in
a way ........that does not diminish the incentives for, or
displace investment by other funders.....</q></p>
<h2>3. Would re-allocation between output classes work?</h2>
<p>The STEP report (MoRST 1992b) suggested that redistribution of
the PGSF from output classes where there is low private funding,
such as agricultural production, to output classes where there is a
high level of private funding, such as secondary processing and
manufacturing, will reduce the possibilities of <q>crowding
out</q>, or funding appropriable research. The report noted that
there were applied research programmes in output areas where there
was also low private sector funding. PGSF funding should be
withdrawn in such an area. The report recommended a strategy for
five year priorities that supported strategic and generic research
in outputs which have high private sector funding, and withdrew
funding from the more applied research programmes in outputs where
there was low private sector funding (MoRST 1992c, p.15).</p>

<p>This observation does not surface in later literature. I would
suggest that the state could complement private sector activity
without specifying whether business was a big spender in that
output or not. I believe the panel got a bit off the track at this
point and got carried away with their complementarity idea.
Re-allocating investment away from one set of outputs (see Table 1)
would leave them worse off, and the gap will not be filled by
private enterprise without greater incentives. In addition, the
high so-called private investment in some sectors was due to the
fact that the <i>industry research associations</i> were
arbitrarily classified as <q>business</q> rather than government
even though they were all established with DSIR seed money! The key
issue is whether public investment can be used to trigger further
private investment in a complementary way, as well as to create
conditions where the <i>up-take</i> of the results of all science
investment is enhanced.</p>
<h2>4. Involving the private sector</h2>
<p>The role of the private sector needs to be looked at from two
different points of view. By international standards, the level of
own investment in research by private New Zealand entities is
low.<a class="f" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" id=
"sdfootnote3anc">(3)</a> This suggests a search for reasons for
firm behaviour in terms of incentives to invest, and rates of
return expected from in-house and industry organisation research.
Second, the level of public research is relatively high but its
up-take by the private sector is perceived to be too low. This
suggests an evaluation of the transfer mechanisms for the up-take
of public good research.</p>

<p>The low participation rate of private sector research in New
Zealand may well be explained by institutional features of the
public and private research markets and not reflect an absence of
incentives <i>per se.</i> In the case of the relatively low rate of
private investment in intra-mural research [R&amp;D activity
carried out by an organisation on its own behalf or the behalf
others], the impediments to greater investment have been identified
by various authors as:</p>
<ol>
<li>the cost of own research is too high in terms of scale and the
results sought;</li>
<li>the returns on investment are too low;</li>
<li>the benefits are too slow in coming in from an initial
investment;</li>
<li>the system of property rights is inadequate;</li>
<li>most companies are too small and dispersed and have an
inadequate skill base; and</li>

<li>the research results are too lumpy or uncertain in their
application.<a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc" href=
"#sdfootnote4sym" id="sdfootnote4anc">(4)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>One answer to these institutional features would be to provide
tax incentives to encourage the entry of new firms as well as
increase the investment of existing firms (see Bollard <i>et al</i>
1987<i>,</i> p.67). Such measures could be designed to lower the
cost of entry to the market for research goods, to lower the costs
of technology transfer, and to lower the costs of intra-mural
research. Such measures have not been tried extensively in New
Zealand hence it is difficult to make a judgement about their
efficacy. But given the history of low participation in the past,
it seems unlikely they would be very effective in making a
significant change in the private rate of R&amp;D investment. In
view of the low status of the TBG programme (see below), which
subsidises very similar objectives, it would appear to me that the
small size of the private research market and its dispersion are
fundamental problems which can only be changed slowly, and which
will not respond to incentives of either sort.<a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" id=
"sdfootnote5anc">(5)</a></p>
<p>Secondly, the private sector can draw upon the pool of research
results derived from public investment in research as well as
carrying out its own research. Prior to 1991, the departmental
sector was the main supplier of public research goods. Since then,
the PGSF system has provided research results as a free or nearly
free good. The characteristics of non-rival consumption of such
public goods means that private firms have some of the initial work
done for them with few restrictions on access. Yet in practice,
there appear to be all sorts of impediments to the up-take of these
research goods by enterprise. There is not, apparently, a
smooth-running market that transforms such free goods into
practical uses. There appear to be transaction costs of some
magnitude (see for example Bollard <i>et al</i> 1987, p.36). The
institutional imperfections, in this case, which prevent higher
utilisation of the knowledge already available, have been
identified as:</p>

<ol>
<li>the [goods] are not in readily usable form;</li>
<li>the costs of further development are considerable;</li>
<li>the <q>stock</q> of research is not easily understood nor
immediately transparent;</li>
<li><q>agents</q> who can explain what is available are
absent;</li>
<li>enterprises are too small to take on further development;</li>
<li>the rate of recovery of development costs is too low;</li>

<li>property rights or patents prevent greater access; and</li>
<li>the discovery and development process takes too long.<a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym" id=
"sdfootnote6anc">(6)</a></li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Policy responses</h2>
Since 1991, various MoRST publications have discussed these issues.
For example, the 2010 Report (MoRST 1995b) is suggestive of market
failure in its discussion of &lsquo;complementary&rsquo; research and the
PGSF.<a class="f" name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" id=
"sdfootnote7anc">(7)</a>
<p>It states that government research will be unproductive if it
not able to be utilised by enterprises. Enterprises should
transform the results of research and technology into tangible
economic benefits. There is a role for government in assisting the
enterprise sector to achieve effective uptake of technology,
particularly if there are transitional problems or barriers
preventing this from happening through market processes - a
possible <i>co-operative approach</i>. The 2010 Report refers to
historically developed attitudes and behaviours which have been
slow to change, such as many enterprises do not have a technology
strategy, technically qualified staff, or any investment in
research. Part of the reasons for this is the small scale of firms,
the high degree of risk aversion, and the high cost of accessing
information.</p>
<p>MoRST suggests that a major policy target should be assistance
to firms making the transition to greater technological awareness.
Access to information could be best assisted by improved
networking, with Government taking a role in sectors which are
highly disaggregated or where there are insufficient firms to make
networking possible (ibid, p.28). In its 2010 Action Agenda, MoRST
planned to strengthen the Technology for Business Growth scheme
(TBG) administered by the Foundation for Research, Science and
Technology (FRST), explore possible funding of `near market'
research outside the PGSF, expand Joint Action Groups established
by Tradenz, and evaluate the effectiveness of the tax system in
achieving investment in innovation, research and technology (ibid,
p.32).<a class="f" name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym" id=
"sdfootnote8anc">(8)</a></p>

<h6>Co-operative research arrangements with the private sector</h6>
<p>In 1996, the TBG had three grant programmes, the Co-operative
Research programme, supporting joint research programmes between
research institutions and companies; the Technology Transfer
programme, encouraging the uptake of existing knowledge; and the
In-House R&amp;D programme, encouraging the expansion of effective
technological capacity within enterprises. The programme financed
up to 50 per cent of R&amp;D costs for an agreed project. Total
funding was $15m per year. In May 1997, FRST was concerned with the
lack of applicants to join the programme [which it administers] and
put it down to companies not having enough technically and
scientifically trained staff to work on the technological
directions they should be moving into (<i>NBR</i>, May 9, 1997). It
was noted that only the electronics and software companies
initiated their own R&amp;D projects and led the private sector in
employment of research scientists.</p>
<p>The Technology New Zealand programme was introduced in mid 1997
and consisted of the original TBG scheme, the Techlink scheme, and
the Graduates in Industry Fellowships (GRIF) scheme. Through
Techlink, business were able to get support for assessment of
technology needs for small and medium businesses; R&amp;D strategy
development; assessing information on overseas technologies and
technological innovations; and evaluation and acquisition of
overseas technologies and technological innovations. The GRIF
programme supports undergraduate, masterate, doctoral and
post-doctoral research undertaken within New Zealand businesses.
The level of uptake of these programmes did not greatly increase in
the two following years (T. Hadfield, FRST, <i>pers.
comm</i>.).</p>
<p>MoRST's policy at this stage, was to encourage co-operative or
complementary investments through the public good science funding
mechanism. In the past, the Manufacturers Federation had expressed
negative views on private sector use of the PGSF system. A survey
of manufacturers in 1995 revealed that 34 per cent thought current
PGSF projects were totally irrelevant and only 6 per cent thought
they were highly relevant; the relevance of the programmes as a
whole was considered very low, and the relevance of intra-sector
programmes (in relation to the respondents own sector) was
extremely low (<i>NBR</i>, March 21, 1997). The Federation was in
favour of an investigation of small company behaviour; how can the
uptake of technology be improved, what infrastructure is required,
and what skills are required? <a class="f" name="sdfootnote9anc"
href="#sdfootnote9sym" id="sdfootnote9anc">(9)</a></p>

<h6>Government responses</h6>
<p>In August 1999, the National Government announced its <i>Bright
Future: 5 Steps Ahead</i> plan. This involved funds for 1500
enterprise scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships, a taskforce
to look at tertiary education, a transfer of money from the PGSF to
a New Economy Research Fund aimed at funding research in new areas,
funds for teacher fellowships, a proposal for a small business
stock exchange, and funds for an <q>ideas incubator</q>. These
proposals focused on facilitating R&amp;D rather direct
interventions such as a tax concession on R&amp;D expenditure.
Ministers did not rule out tax concessions at some later date. The
policy was clearly based on a new appreciation of a knowledge-based
global economic environment. The proposals aimed to expand the
nation's intellectual and knowledge base to encourage an innovatory
approach to R&amp;D, and sought to encourage industry to undertake
a more strategic role in knowledge development . Out of this, a
greater commitment from the business world to R&amp;D might emerge
(<i>NBR</i> August 20 1999).</p>
<p>The 2000 Budget appears at first sight (as this paper went to
press) to build on this approach. Total public investment in
research, science and technology is $473.9m, a rise of 10 per cent
on the previous year. New funding of $30m is to be allocated to
private sector research encouragement, the New Economy Research
Fund, and the Marsden Fund. The private sector component consists
of a $9m increase in funding for Technology New Zealand and a new
$12m grants programme (details not provided). The question of tax
concessions has again been set aside though Ministers left the door
open to further negotiations. The Minister of Finance told
Parliament after the Budget presentation that it had been estimated
that revenue of $100m -$120m would be lost through businesses using
such a scheme for tax avoidance (<i>Evening Post</i> 21 June).</p>

<p>These policy announcements represent an incremental change to
existing policies for private sector co-operation and support in
R&amp;D. Their effects on business behaviour will have to be
assessed further down the track. What remains to be done is to
examine <i>actual</i> research fund allocations since the reforms
commenced.</p>
<h2>6. Evidence for increased participation of private entities in
R&amp;D</h2>
<p>Positive changes in the physical quantum of private investment
in research (funding) is one measure of greater participation by
the private sector. The second measure is the quantum of research
conducted by private sector interests - approximately measured by
the expenditure incurred by private research providers.<a class="f"
name="sdfootnote10anc" href="#sdfootnote10sym" id=
"sdfootnote10anc">(10)</a> Measuring the effects of complementary
spending by the PGSF is difficult (apart from case studies), but
could possibly yield to some form of covariance analysis if data
were available. The overall rate of up-take of public research
goods by the private sector can be measured by an aggregate
econometric analysis of sector performance<a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" id=
"sdfootnote11anc">(11)</a> The following analysis is based on the
actual trends measured in the MoRST surveys.</p>

<h6>Funding: has government's share of research spending
diminished?</h6>
<p>The trend in research <i>funding</i> by institutional category
since 1990-91 is shown in Table 2. The government contribution to
departments, universities, CRIs and the private sector has grown
from $437m to $579m in money terms or 32 per cent up to 1997-98.
The business contribution to departments, universities, CRIs and
the private sector has grown from $213m to $338m, or 58 per cent
over 7 years, while the universities/other have expanded their
funding by 153 per cent. The latter includes <q>own</q> funds (fees
and earnings) for the universities, private non-profit funds and
all other funds. Thus private funding of <q>own</q> research and
research in other entities has expanded markedly and well above the
government's contribution as the policy decisions dictated.</p>

<h6>Funding: where is private funding being allocated?</h6>
<p>Further detail of private funding of research is shown in Table
3. There has been a rapid expansion of private funds going into
both government and university research providing institutions.
Overall funding by the private sector in New Zealand increased by
58 per cent, but business <q>own</q> research funded only increased
by 36 per cent. Private sector funds allocated to government
increased by 203 per cent, and funds allocated to universities
increased by 224 per cent. The use of these funds (particularly by
the CRIs) is discussed further below. Total funds provided by the
private sector have increased by 6.9 per cent per year while
private spending on research within house has only increased by 4.4
per cent per year.</p>

<h6>Funding: where are the universities getting their funding?</h6>
<p>The involvement of the private sector in university funding is
shown in Table 4. This shows the source of funds for all university
research undertaken. While the main source is Vote Education, this
has declined and then built up over the years shown. The next most
important sources are `own funds' and the rest of government
(FRST). Starting from a low base, private sector funding increased
up to 1996 and then declined. The shifts in funding in university
research have been quite considerable in recent years and reflect
changes in the internal organisation of all university funding.
Evidently, an earlier trend to finance university research by the
private sector has not continued.</p>

<h6>Providers: who provides the research facilities and carries out
the research?</h6>

<p>Trends in <i>expenditure</i> in the different institutional
providers is shown in Table 5. The university data is only fully
reliable from 1992-93; but the surveys of the business and
government sectors have been consistent through the whole period
shown. Business providers have expanded expenditure in money terms
at 6.3 per cent per year since 1990-91, government providers by 3
per cent, and the universities by 13.5 per cent per year. Over the
same period, the GDP deflator increased by 23 per cent or 3 per
cent per year; hence the private sector (firms and industry
associations) and the universities have been able to actually spend
more real resources in the years since the reforms began. The
Budget constraints on the government sector are confirmed.</p>

<h6>Providers: have the CRIs established themselves in the private
sector?</h6>
<p>Table 7 shows trends in private earnings among the different
CRIs [who are classified by MoRST as <q>government</q>] and their
dependence on public funds. AgResearch, NIWA, Landcare, and
HortResearch have expanded into the private sector the most. The
gross total of private funding of CRIs has risen from $115.7m in
1993 to $173.3m in 1999 (+50 per cent). Most CRIs get about two
thirds of their funding from the Crown; only ESR is an exception.
Some of this difference is explained by the way ESR's funders are
classified by the Auditor-General as non-crown.<a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym" id=
"sdfootnote12anc">(12)</a></p>
<p>This shift in the funding of R&amp;D is the most transparent
feature of the science reforms. The bidding process for FRST funds
and its consequent transaction costs have rationed public sector
funds to the CRIs as was probably intended by the science reformers
like Treasury. Perusal of the Annual Reports of the CRIs indicates
a high level of search activity for new funding.</p>

<p>In summary, this section shows that private enterprises (which
include the research associations) are investing proportionately
less in their own R&amp;D, and slowly increasing funds to other
research providers. They are drawing more funds from FRST and
overseas sources. They are providing more funds to the CRIs and the
universities. In turn, some CRIs are expanding their private
funding sources more rapidly than others. The amount invested in
university research by private enterprise is small and has not
increased in recent years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Concluding observations</h2>
<p>The data for justifying government intervention in the New
Zealand R&amp;D market has not been generated until recently. High
public investments in the past were explained by paternalistic
policies which assumed that producers were not able to organise nor
fund their own R&amp;D. Industry involvement started with the
government sponsorship of industry research associations on a
partial funding basis which later grew to fully self-sufficient
institutes. Conduct of government research was partially privatised
when the Crown Research Institutes were established in 1991.</p>

<p>In terms of crowding out, the verdict is not proven. <a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote13anc" href="#sdfootnote13sym" id=
"sdfootnote13anc">(13)</a> In a historic sense, Government was
dominant in spending and setting the priorities. To this extent, an
alternative system did not develop. However, this review suggests
that in the past the spending and the priorities established were
not the right ones for the business sector (in the main). Since
government was not doing the research that suited business it can
hardly be said that private research was crowded out. The review
shows that New Zealand firms were too small (on average), too
dispersed by region and type of output, and unwilling to invest in
the necessary skills and planning. Benefits were too slow in coming
in the face of high discount rates for the private sector, and
communication of known research results was deficient.</p>
<p>The reasons for the small size of the private research market
remain:</p>
<ol>
<li>the historic dominance of government conducted research;</li>
<li>the small size of private companies, on average;</li>
<li>the historic dominance of research into primary
production;</li>
<li>the removal of government funding from research
associations;</li>
<li>the shift in emphasis in information and communications away
from the private sector;</li>

<li>a gap between what the government system provided and the
private sector's capacity to utilise the results;</li>
<li>the really big achievements of the past (plant breeding, animal
breeding, aerial topdressing) only benefited primary production and
not the firms servicing the farm sector and elsewhere; and</li>
<li>a history of protectionism in New Zealand
manufacturing.<a class="f" name="sdfootnote14anc" href=
"#sdfootnote14sym" id="sdfootnote14anc">(14)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The expansion of private funding into the CRIs and to a lesser
extent the universities indicates a willingness to sponsor more
research if not to conduct more. More information is needed to
discover any special characteristics of this process though it
clearly conforms with MoRST objectives. To obtain the benefits of
such sponsorship, the private sector needs to be closely associated
with the research programmes and its objectives including its
transfer potential to the real situation. The association with the
universities also provides a challenge to see that the results are
applicable in practice and some positive national benefit emerges
from the investment.</p>

(1996, pp.5,10-11, 20) discusses some of the lag effects in

networking, and the `tacitness and inarticulate nature of much

seems to have arrived at a similar conclusion. <q>While inadequate
private sector investment in R&amp;D is widely cited as the primary
reason for public investment in R&amp;D, this viewpoint alone does
not provide a basis to say exactly what Government should do, how
it should do it, and how much it should do. Determining what the
Government should do cannot be easily settled by economic theory.
To ensure that private sector investment is not crowded out, the
Government must focus resources where markets are most likely to
fail. Recent analyses have shown a significant positive correlation
between public spending on research (generally on strategic
research) and business-funded R&amp;D activities. `Induced'
privately funded R&amp;D is linked to knowledge transfer between
publicly and privately funded R&amp;D programmes..... The boundary
between public and private R&amp;D is unlikely to be absolute, and
will vary between firms, industries and sectors depending on the
extent of maarket failure</q>.</p>

pp.163-4) survey, financial institutions stated that the needs of
innovative firms for project advice, financial planning, and the
provision of equity and initial loan capital were not being met.
There were also serious shortcomings in the range of management
skills posessed by those persons within the innovative firms who
are responsible for dealing with financial matters. The BERL report
also notes that scientific and technological information reaches
small and medium enterprises essentially through networks which
are usually informal. The TIWG Report states that there are 20,000
manufacturing enterprises of which 6,000 have a staff of more than
5, 750 have a staff of more than 50. Only 70 enterprises undertake
private R&amp;D programmes.</p>

doubts whether market failure explains the fundamental causes of
underinvestment. Government failure may be present as well as
market failure. Excessive transaction costs constrain economic
behaviour and prevent exchanges that would occur in frictionless
markets. More emphasis should be given to tests of
appropriability.</p>

the Technological Innovation Working Group (TIWG) in September 1996
to examine and report on these issues. The group identified three
areas of strategic focus: raising the technological competence and

within which technology investments are made is free of regulatory,
institutional and other impediments; and enhancing the integration
of NZ firms into the global technology market.</p>

says it is questionable whether many industries failed to invest in
R&amp;D because of a view that is is a government responsibility.
Cuts in funding in the 1980s did not bring about a corresponding
increase in private R&amp;D investment. Patchy data suggest it is
reducing public R&amp;D investment that leads to reduced industry
R&amp;D. On the other hand, the TIWG (p.29) recommended that
<q>....PGSF should be managed in a way that maximises the adopting
and application of PGSF results by users, without at the same time,
crowding out or displacing non PGSF funding</q>.</p>

<p><a class="sdfootnotesym" name="sdfootnote14sym" href=
"#sdfootnote14anc" id="sdfootnote14sym">14</a> Winsley (1996)
suggests that publicly funded research reduced incentives for
scientists and their managers to perform, by shielding them from
competitive pressures and from the need to interact with industry.
The departmental science structures created difficulties in
monitoring performance and the strategic direction of science, and
core funding negated any competitive pressures. The science reforms
have created some of the characteristics of a market for research
which is now conducted by entities that replicate many of the
incentive structures, commercial powers and behavioural traits of
private firms. In the BERL Report (p.177), the authors note that
the manufacturing sector had a strong dependency on the government
in the 1970s. While complaining about government interference, most
firms saw government as having a major responsibility for problem
solving.</p>
