<p class="abstract">This paper explores the application of property
rights to sustainable land management objectives. Property rights
are briefly defined and discussed in terms of the Torrens system of
land registration. Incentive schemes for soil conservation are
assessed against the property rights background. Alternative
systems of property rights are discussed after the manner of Bromley and Hodge. 
The application of such a changed system of property rights is assessed for practicality and technical
achievement.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The traditional system for achieving changes in farm management
practice in terms of soil conservation objectives in Australia and
New Zealand has been to offer a system of incentive payments to
land holders targeted on needed conservation objectives. These
incentives recognised the strong bargaining position of the
landholders both politically and legally. Their political power
stemmed form their dominance in the early legislatures while their
legal power stemmed from the system of land registration first
introduced by Torrens in South Australia. The thrust of the
argument to be presented here is that the Torrens system was too
successful in achieving its primary objective of title security and
lacked the flexibility to be adaptable to needed changes in
practice when these became necessary in the pursuit of the national
good.</p>
<p>This paper first discusses the nature of property rights with
specific reference to land holding and defines what is regarded as
an efficient set of property rights. The characteristics of
property rights are compared for freehold and leasehold tenure.
Reference is made to how water and mineral rights relate to these
attributes. The paper then goes on to examine Bromley and Hodge's
proposition that a re-distribution of land property rights would be
an alternative method of reaching current perceived land
management standards at considerably less cost to the exchequer. We
conclude by assessing how practical their proposition is and
whether it is technically achievable.</p>
<h3>Property Rights</h3>
<p>Property rights are a set of behavioural rules that people
choose to observe and accomodate to. Dragun (1990) refers to "the
social pattern of rights and duties". They can be established
through custom, convention or law (Hide, 1987). The essential fact
is that they are observed rather than sanctified by law. In
general, they can be established through custom, convention, or
law. In land use such rules specify who may use a resource and how
the resource may be used. Such rules allow exchange to take place
with some security and therefore assist in allocating resources
among competing interests. The market works precisely because it is
backed up by a set of property rights.</p>
<p>Exchange of property rights is based on their exclusivity and
transferability. An exclusive property right is the ownership of a
car; a common property right is the right to use the roads. One is
exclusive and transferable and one is not. The right to exclude,
says Hide, is a pre-condition to the right to trade. An exchange
permits a value to be established hence we can talk about a market
for property rights. Exclusive property rights must be specified
and policed, and contracts for the exchange of rights must be
negotiated and enforced. (Cars have ownership papers and the courts
enforce owners rights when they are violated) .</p>
<p>There are at least six characteristics of property rights that
qualify their usefulness in economic exchanges (Scott, 1989).</p>
<p>Figure 1 shows a diagrammatic representation of these six
characteristics of interest in rights which are based on the
following descriptors:</p>
<p><u>Duration</u>: length of time an arrangement holds for; a period in
which a rightholder can profitably invest in harvesting (Scott).</p>
<p><u>Flexibility</u>: discretion to change use; what can and cannot be
done without consulting others.</p>
<p><u>Exclusivity</u>: the strength of a right; the inverse of the number
of persons who must be contacted to internalise enterprises like
fishing (Scott); freedom from disturbance; strength of acceptance
by the community.</p>
<p><u>Quality of Title</u>: legal protection and security provided by
common law and things like registration systems; acceptance by
others.</p>
<p><u>Transferability</u>: ability to transfer to others; number of
parties to whom a transfer can be made (Scott).</p>
<p><u>Divisibility/Assemblability</u>: ability to sub-divide; ability to
aggregate; ability to share; ability to have joint holders (Scott);
abiliy to assist transferability (Scott).</p>
<p>Scott then says the amount of each characteristic in a standard
interest can usefully be regarded as observable, measurable and
continuously variable. For example, each may be scored from a 100.
This relates to other writers who h3ve used value-laden terms such
as "incomplete", "imperfect", "attenuated", or "propertyness".
Furthermore, these characteristics can be regarded as a six-pointed
star-shaped figure formed by joining its measured points on the six
characteristics axes. This is what is shown in Figure 1.</p>

</table>

<p>It is possible to use such a diagram to compare two systems of
property rights. In Figure 1, a freehold system of land tenure is
compared with a leasehold system. The right to occupy land is well
understood in Australia and New Zealand. Fairly arbitrary scoring on
the 0 - 100 scale has been used for this example. But in general
freehold systems of land tenure are very high on most attributes
other than exclusivity (there is not a lot of protection from the
actions of others) while leasehold tenure scores weakly except on
transferability and quality of title. The resulting linkages
between characteristics in the diagram thus form "pictures" of
different property right systems.</p>
<p>An alternative formulation to Scott's characteristics is
described by the concept of attenuation (Quiggin, 1986) as
indicated above. Any limitation on the way in which property rights
may be used constitutes attenuation. The ideal, unattenuated state
is approximated by private chattel ownership where the owner has
completely free rights of use, exclusion and alienation. The
attenuation of property rights, in this view, will always
reduce their value to the owner, and is sometimes
viewed as undesirable (ie by the followers of Coase). This is
particularly true when attenuation is the result of actions of
governments, such as regulatory limits on the way in which property
may be used or restrictions on the sale and purchase of property.
Dragun points out that the key features of non-attenuation are
complete specification of the right, exclusive specification, full
transferability and enforceability (Dragun, 1990). Jacobsen (1991)
points out that the ownership conferred by property rights does not
normally entail the right to impose costs on others. Rights are
attenuated to prevent adverse consequences to others, and in turn
protect owners from the actions of others. For further discussion
of the philosophical origins of these terms see Alchian and Demsetz
(1973), Castle (1978), Quiggin (1986), Izac (1986), Cox, Lowe and
Winter (1988), and Dragun (1990) among others.</p>

<p>An <u>efficient</u> set of property rights refers to minimising the
costs of making changes to right holdings, the costs of policing
and the costs of establishment (eg registration). Hide (1987) gives
an analysis of transaction costs and their relation to efficiency.
The Torrens system of land registration is a very efficient set
of property rights because it provides high security at low
registration cost, it requires low policing costs and changes can be
made with very little trouble. Most New Zealanders and
Australians do not realise that the registration of title to their
dwelling site confers such a wide set of benefits on them
personally. For this we can thank our forefathers! Such things as
planning tribunals and legal niceties raise the costs of many
exchanges of property rights and hence can be seen as counters to
efficiency. Poor design in legislation could be one reason for
this. Thus an efficient set of property rights is a well designed
set, widely trusted by the people involved and not subject to
vexatious litigation. Conflict does arise, however, and the courts
may be the only way to resolve difficulties between conflicting
interests.</p>

<p>There is some conflict in the literature with this definition of
efficiency. Bradsen (1988) discusses at some length the merits of
cost-benefit analysis particularly the use of social discount
rates. He allows that such analysis is needed for major works; but
says preventative practices should be treated differently. He does
not distinguish between project costs and transaction costs and
hence never really defines what we would call an efficient
solution. Jacobsen (1991) discusses social cost-benefit analyses
incorporating the depreciation of natural capital as a cost.
Subsequent discussion indicates that this author is including
transaction costs, "high costs of public ownership" for example,
without distinguishing the different context.</p>

<h3>Property Rights in Land</h3>
<p>Australia and New Zealand have well-developed and efficient sets
of land property rights. The system is so well designed that it
provides full security at low cost, has low policing costs and
provides a high degree of protection. The system is so well thought
of that a market for land operates without any doubt as to the
authenticity of the title or the potential risks.</p>
<p>The right of ownership then confers on the owner further
rights as to how he might use that right. He may prevent
trespass, he can choose any land use he likes, he can erect a
building and he can sell any product from that land without
encumbrance. (We use "use" in the town planning sense rather than a
farming sense). Titles can have attachments to them such as the
registration of debt secured against that title. In Western
Australia, notices to occupiers of land from the commissioner of
soil conservation can be registered with the appropriate land
registrar (Looney, 1991). Attachments lower the exchange value of
a right.</p>
<p>In general, freehold or full tenure confers more security on the
titleholder than a leasehold system (this clearly relates to our
forefathers' experience in England, Scotland and Ireland). Figure
1 explains this difference from the point of view of the various
characteristics of interest in a right. Kirby and Blyth (1987) are
very critical of the problems caused by leasehold systems of tenure
in Australia.</p>
<p>The rights of use have become constrained by social controls in
a number-of instances . Town and Country Planning Acts and Mineral
legislation, for example, constrain access, building rights, and
subdivision typically. They do not constrain the selling of the
product, however, though cases of this do occur (see indigenous
forest discussion below for example).</p>
<p>In the historical context, these property rights facilitated the
opening up of the land. They provided an incentive to develop and
enabled the developer to capture all the gains from his occupation.
They also secured him a reward when he had finished developing as
the right was immediately transferable to others at a market
determined price backed by the very system of which it was
part.</p>
<p>In the longer run, it was inevitable that some of the (social)
costs of development of the land were not captured in the market
process. In particular, deterioration in surface cover, soil loss,
sediment transmission, salinity levels, and water quality loss can
still occur within the Torrens system of property rights, which
was otherwise so efficient in achieving its purposes. The
conditions of use of the right allowed these things to happen and
no sanctions were introduced to prevent them happening for a long
period. The position was worse where leasehold land was concerned
(Kirby and Blyth, 1987).</p>
<p>Salinity is a well-documented case of an externality arising out
of seepage (Hodge, 1982; Quiggin, 1986; Kirby and Blyth, 1987). The
debate ranges over the respective merits of negotiation,
incentives, trading rights and regulation. There is also a clear
line of argument connecting market failure with information
deficiencies both at the landholder level and local government
(Wills, 1987). wills also suggests that distortion is not absent
from information supplied to government by interested parties. A
good overview of the extent of land degradation in Australia, and
of the legal structures in place, which I found useful, is given in
Looney (1991).</p>
<p>When changes (in externalities) take place, the system ot
property rights is no longer efficient and effacious. A new system
of property rights is needed to reflect societal value which at the
same time minimise transaction costs. In New Zealand the new
Resource Management Act epitomises the new set of social values and
indicates that both regulatory and market based measures may be
used to reach the Act's objectives. Such legislation must be
scrutinised very carefully from the property right point of view
just because new solutions and the consequential legal provisions
could potentially be very expensive or vexatious to introduce or
bring about.</p>
<p>In our language the Torrens system does not deal well with
externalities. The above examples are the long term impacts of the
human use of land which affect others than the right holder. It can
be stated that they occur as a result of the inability to negotiate
and enforce an exchange of the relevant property rights (Hide). The
inability arises because physical or technical factors prevent the
parties getting together or they simply went unobserved. They are
typically non-point sources of degradation.</p>
<p>In the-case of soil erosion on slopes, the downstream owner's
rights are not protected; there is no market in "rights to cause
soil loss" and transfer the costs; there is no point discharge on
which to fix a levy; solutions up to the present have been based on
incentives (bribes in the Bromley language) to degraders to stop or
control the relevant practice. One solution is to bring the
degraders and the recipients together in a common rating system and
spread the costs of treatment; in this way the externality can be
internalised!</p>
<p>Legislation like the Resource Management Act can be viewed as an
exercise in the redistribution of property rights. Legislation can
place restrictions of all sorts on the use of resources governed by
property rights and hence can potentially change land use itself.
For example, previously the Mining Act had prior rights over
freehold rights with respect to prospecting for minerals.
Developers could cross private land for this purpose. In the
Resource Management Bill it was proposed that land owners could
have a veto over such access. In the resulting Crown Minerals Act
(the relevant sections were spun off the Resource Management Act)
clauses 55 and 63 simply state the classes of land which will not
be subject to an access arrangement after the appointment of an
arbitrator. The strengthening of the rights of surface landholders
has not taken place. From an efficiency point of view, a low cost
system is needed to reduce the costs of undue negotiation and
litigation where the national interest is involved.</p>
<p>The scope of such legislation is also governed by property
rights. By scope, we mean all those persons and corporates who may
be affected by the provisions. Control over resources means control
over the users of resources. The users are already in occupation
and have established formal and informal rights. The domain of such
legislation is defined as being all property held under some system
of rights whether it be freehold land (registered title) or some
other right conferred by custom, agreement or contract.</p>

<p>Property rights are important in land precisely because
they enable social control over resource use and management (Hide).
Through reform and adaptation, the use and management of resources
is improved. In adapting property rights, society adjusts the
respective roles of the state and the individual and explores the
ability of political and market mechanisms to manage the resource
stock better.</p>
<h3>Water Rights</h3>
<p>Water rights are an example where social considerations often
outweigh the desires of the individual. "First come" rights derived
from prior access have given way to riparian doctrines that
consider water a public resource held in trust by the Crown (OECD,
1987). Permits or licences are used to allocate the resource thus
substituting administrative procedure and/or legal covenants for a
market in single use rights. Current criticism is based on the
imperfections of such administrative systems as they do not
adequately provide for recreation, conservation and spiritual
values, do not provide for other water uses, and do not provide an
efficient set of rights, (Moore and Arthur-Worsop, 1989).</p>
<p>The new school maintains that a system of well-defined and
tradeable property rights would be more socially advantageous than
administered systems. They could provide greater flexibility and
security, better information on resource values, minimal
transaction costs and the ability to accommodate new resource values
(Checcchio and Colby, 1988; Hide, 1987). Flexibility comes from
being able to allocate water in accord with demand and changing use
values. Security is gained by actual ownership of the right, as
opposed to Crown ownership. The allocation process has the
potential to be more transparent as resource values will emerge
through bidding among alternative users. In a well-defined
statutory environment information regarding transfer arrangements
and possibilities are more transparent thus limiting uncertainty
and ultimately transaction costs. These conclusions are consistent
with the description of non-attenuated rights given earlier.</p>
<p>Administrative systems hide or disguise transaction costs.
Public control apologists would no doubt say that the end justifies
the means. But from an economic point of view achieving an
<u>efficient</u> set of water property rights should be the target of
public policy. A market for water rights creates opportunities for
new uses to be recognised at relatively low cost. It would probably
<u>not</u> provide for all recreation, conservation and spiritual values
unless the respective lobbies were forced to "buy" their
requirements. However, investigating, assessing and verifying all
claims to a water source (not to mention appeals and legal
proceedings) remains a high transaction cost process. Therefore
legislative solutions in the water rights area must be particularly
well-designed to achieve the potential efficiencies that are
possible.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that water markets will not perform
perfectly (OECD, 1987, Ch 2). Market based allocations may not
recognise the proper social accounting.(or shadow) prices. 
In a multiple resource use situation some uses will be difficult to
identify and measure, and the mix of private and public goods will greatly complicate the design of an efficient property rights
system. The presence of some public good aspects in the solution
will always lead to some under-statement of demand. The OECD report
(editors Bromley and Pearce) concludes that one system cannot be
judged preferable to the other, and that member countries should
choose their own policy objectives for water, resource management
according to their own goals and objectives.</p> 
<p>Under the Resource Management Act, New Zealand is moving to a system of transferable
water permits. The responsibility for implementing them will fall on
regional councils who will establish the regulatory and allocative
framework for granting in-stream rights. Experience from South
Australia has been quoted as indicating that with resource scarcity
and effective regulations, water markets can achieve better water
allocation (Moore and Arthur-Worsop). On the other hand,
uncertainty over the tenure of water rights in Victoria and New
South Wales has slowed up the development of markets in those
areas (Verdich, 1986). Further analysis is obviously needed of
these questions before we can be at all categoric about the
relative efficiency of different allocation systems.</p> 
<h3>Mineral Rights</h3>
<p>In this section we only discuss mineral rights as they bear on land
access questions (for a general discussion of mining property
rights in New Zealand, see Jardine and Scobie, 1990). Under New
Zealand mining legislation the surface owner has a right of veto
over access on certain classes of land only. These classes include
land under some horticultural use, land in urban areas, land under
burial grounds, airstrips, waterworks, roads, bridges or buildings,
and all conservation land. The remainder is open to access (for
exploration) without consent of the owner and makes up most of the
pastoral farmland and exotic forest estate.</p> 

<p>In the Resource Management Bill, it was proposed that land owners should have a
veto over prospecting, exploration and mining on all land. In the
past the mining rights had over-ridden the occupation rights. The
proposed veto changed the distribution of property rights and hence
the incentive to invest and develop. Such a veto would discriminate
against the Crown as a mineral and petroleum owner. It would also
reduce the incentive to explore for minerals and raise the
transaction costs of getting access. This would reduce the
efficiency of the set of property rights held by the explorers. It
would transfer windfall gains from the old owners of rights to the
new owners and could result in a lower rate of over-all development
of the economy.</p> 
<p>This is another case of the <u>relative</u> efficiency of
two systems. From the point of view of the landholder he is
interested in getting rid of (mining) rights that have priority
over the ones he holds. From the point of view of the explorer, and
indeed of the nation, the <u>status quo</u> was all about enabling society
to have it both ways; one use of the land can continue to be
developed while the potential to use it for something else is
not foregone. Environmentalists had sided with the landholders in
the debate as they wanted greater impediments to mining development
as an absolute goal. In the event the status quo was preserved in
the Crown Minerals Act and further testing and analysis of the
relative merits of the two systems of property rights has been
passed over.</p> 
<h3>Indigenous Forest</h3> 
<p>This case is briefly discussed as it
an example of regulations being used to control the use of the
product derived from the possession of a right. In 1989, New
Zealand introduced a set of regulations prohibiting the felling of
indigenous trees for export purposes. The regulations were part of
an attempt to conserve the native forest estate as well as trying
to conform to advanced international standards of behaviour with
respect to the felling of indigenous forests.</p> 
<p>The ban on exports effectively used an administrative decree to limit the harvest of
trees on privately held land. The regulations prevented landholders
from felling timber for export purposes without compensation. Thus
the surface owners interest in the land was made subservient to the
public interest.</p> 
<p>From the landholders point of view here was an
arbitary decision to limit the sources of his income. It appeared
there were cases where the exploitation of this resource was
essential to the continued viability of the individual enterprise.
Subsequent negotiations recogised this fact and a form of
compensation was agreed to. The new government elected in 1990 has
since put the forest regulations on hold.</p> 
<p>From the environmental point of view it was regarded as imperative that New Zealand made
an international gesture as early as possible.</p> 
<p>From an efficiency point of view, the proposal was disadvantageous. The plan would
have involve the preparation of a sustainable harvest plan approved
by the Ministry of Forestry. The costs of this plan, especially if
it involves survey costs, could make this option non-operable for
many smaller freehold areas of forest. Some discussion was also
based on the introduction of a felling fee to discourage use of the
private forest estate. In all these cases the transaction costs of
the conservation goal would have been high.</p> 
<h3>Sustainability</h3> 
<p>The Resource Management Act in New Zealand is effectively a change in
the social paradigm that directs land and water resource use. The
concept of sustainability lies at the centre of the Act's
provisions. In the Act sustainability is defined as "managing
the use, development, and protection of natural and physical
resources in a way, or at a rate, which enables people and
communities to provide for their social, economic and cultural
wellbeing and for their health and safety while: a) sustaining the
potential of natural and physical resources (excluding minerals) to
meet the reasonably foreseeable needs of future generations; and b)
safeguarding the life-supporting capacity of air, water, soil,
and ecosystems; and c) avoiding; remedying, or mitigating any
adverse effects of activities on the environment".</p> 
<p>In New Zealand the Soil and Water Conservation Act was passed in 1941 and the Town
and Country Planning Act in 1948. These Acts have gradually
introduced definitions of what could be called "good" land and
water use and provided mechanisms for national and local government
to pursue such goals. The legislative provisions impose restriction
on the holders of land rights and represent reductions (or
attenuations) in the original property right granted to them,
bought by them, or inherited by them.</p> 
<p>In general, the cooperation of landholders (in soil conservation particularly) has been gained
by a system of incentives for changes in management practices . As
earlier mentioned, common law rights to water were abolished by the
Water and Soil Act 1977 and control shifted to the State.
Subdivision, changes in use (including buildings), and peri-urban
development were all "licensed" under the town and country planning
regulations. In the new Act, local government will be
responsible for amending or continuing the ordinances which will
have higher standards to meet than in the past. (The range of
potential controls and administrative systems is very wide; further
space will not be taken up with discussing them here). As Castle
(1978) says, such legislation represents a dissatisfaction with the
consequences of private holdings in land and a belief that a
comprehensive approach holds the key to many resource and
environmental problems. In the United States, the emphasis on the
role of local and state government was consistent with a
disenchantment with big, central government. Castle notes that
federal pressure was required to make western states amend their
water legislation as all the available water had already been
privately appropriated.</p> 
<p>Castle was concerned with the impact of
macro policies for employment, prices and income. He found that the
full cost of these policies will not be reflected at the national
level but at the state and local government level. Macro policy
impacts put pressure on the existing system of property rights.
Local control mechanisms were slow to respond. Systems are needed
to give a better combination of federal, state and local control
and guidance to meet society's wider objectives.</p> 

<p>This shift in the national paradigm is reflected a recent paper from Australia
(Bradsen, 1990). In a paper on the effectiveness of soil
conservation legislation, he reviews Australian definitions of
sustainability in current legislation, and the relation of
incentives, compulsion and regulation to ensure proper use of land.
He concludes (he is a lawyer and landholder) that licensing is not
generally an appropriate way to deal with land degradation; he
believes obligations should first be imposed, not on landholders,
but on government, especially if land conservation is administered
by agencies whose ethos is historically rooted largely in
exploitation (see Bradsen, 1988, for details). This obligation
should involve ensuring that land is objectively assessed
particularly to determine its capabilities, whether they are being
exceeded, and what solutions are appropriate.</p>

<p>He says the obligation on landholders should involve the preparation of
property plans consistent with a regional plan. It should include
the need for substantial compliance with both. It should <u>not</u> rely
on incentives. "Australia's departure in the 30s and 40s from the
Australian way of dealing with land management problems, such as
pest plants, animals and insects, to rely on the US voluntary,
awareness, education, approach to land degradation can perhaps be
excused,...It has not been effective and continued reliance on
this approach cannot be excused. The commitment of substantial
community funds compounds the error, especially in the absence of
accountability according to proper land conservation standards"
(Bradsen, 1990, p 11).</p>
<p>Without using property rights language,
Bradsen is in favour of the attenuation of land use rights to
eliminate externalities and meet desired standards. He recommends
compulsory property plans incorporating sustainability principles.
This would be backed up by some system of enforcement, including
the power of aquisition, an appeal system, and provision for formal
reports and periodic reviews~ Landholders should, for a period of
adjustment, <u>not</u> be required to meet all costs on a polluter pays
basis; considerable sums of Commonwealth finance will be required.
Looney (1991) covers a lot of this ground as well.</p> 

<p>Thus Bradsen's emphasis is on compliance and standards and the means to best
achieve these. There is no accounting of transaction costs of the
alternatives. It is essentially goal driven. This example is
useful as we go on to discuss less attenuated systems for achieving
the same objectives.</p> 
<h3>Incentives </h3>

<p>Over a considerable area of land conservation, and particularly for soil conservation, systems of
cash incentives have been used to encourage good land management
practices. This system of subsidies and concessions (bribes) is
necessary, say Bromley and Hodge (1990), to counter-balance the
existing set of property rights. They see the state becoming more
and more involved with technological externalities of existing land
use practices as the state represents the section of society
affected by the unwanted effects of agricultural land use. The
state's response has been either to introduce some form of
regulation in which specific quantitative goals will be set, or a
set of financial inducements to obtain compliance from the
agricultural community. The process is accompanied by extensive
political negotiations in either case. In effect, say Bromley and
Hodge, the presumed property rights in land become translated
through the political process, into presumptive entitlements in the
policy area (see also Cox, Lowe and Winter, 1988).</p> 
<p>But such arrangements need not be fixed in concrete; "The presumption of an
absolute right to produce food and fibre creates an open-ended
agricultural policy in which the state and its treasury - has
become the captive of the sancity of private rights in land, the
political power of the farmers, and the technological prowess of
modern agriculture. If farmers are on a technological treadmill,
the industrial state is surely on a fiscal treadmill. The generally
secure position which landowners enjoy, however, has no immutable
legitimacy - though its political legitimacy is another matter.
Institutional arrangements are social creations, fashioned to serve
collective objectives".</p> 
<p>Bromley and Hodge propose an alternative
approach. They suggest that the state defines a desirable system of
land use compatible with environmental objectives, and that
existing practices be measured against this desirable system. "The
desired level of countryside and community attributes would be
determined through collective action at the local level, but with
wider oversight if the domain of concern transcended the locality".
A plan for a particular area would specify the constraints over
land use required to achieve the desired level of environmental
quality. Farmers would remain free to choose enterprises and
methods of production so long as the final result does not violate
the plan. In effect, the property rights which formerly resided
with the farmer are transferred to the collective entity.</p> 

<p>To make the system flexible, it is suggested that the farmer be given a
right to deviate from the plan by paying into the public purse.
This represents a turnaround of the incentive system where the
farmers bribe the state rather than the state bribing the farmers.
The deviation from the standard would presumably lead to greater
private income from that permitted and hence would be a source of
the payments that would flow to the state. The farmer would have to
weigh up the alternatives. If instituted, such a system would
reverse the direction of payments from the traditional pattern.</p> 

<p>The authors discuss the administration of such a system of property
rights. A considerable administration would be required in terms of
specifying the appropriate constraints for the various regions of a
country, and in systems for assuring various regions of a country,
and in systems for assuring compliance. The mix of environmental
objectives could be quite wide and complex and would differ for
different regions. In New Zealand, a new set of goals and
standards would need to be evolved. Point sources would be easier
to accomodate than nonpoint sources. A considerable scientific
input would be required (though there are similarities here to
Bradsen's approach). Current legislation would have to be
re-drafted to meet the holistic systems approach put forward.</p> 

<p>The proposed system would bring about a realignment of all the
incentives to produce. Policy instruments that give financial
incentives to farmers would disappear. Production levels would be
governed by the system of permits which allowed deviations from the
ideal (Bromley and Hodge assume that the ideal is not at the top of
the production possibility curve) Generally, output would be most
modified where farming systems were heavily dependant on sensitive
environmental inputs.</p> 
<p>The costs of production would be higher (except in the case of zero use of enviromental inputs if such
could be found). Costs would increase either to meet
the new standards or in bribing the authorities to get departures.
Output positions would dependent on the particular effect of each
environmental constraint. It seems plausible that the costs of
meeting the standards would depress the value of the land right and
hence land values; the higher the standards are set above practice
the lower the resulting land value.</p> 

<p>Finally, agricultural producers would come to be regarded as land managers rather than producers (a
lot would claim this already; the debate on landcare groups comes
in here). If increased costs drive up market prices for products,
then consumers would be paying a tax for product produced in an
environmentally sound way. This would be an estimate of the social
cost of current agricultural practice. If the complete system were
to be accepted and to be instituted successfully, the environmental
externalities of existing agricultural systems would have been
internalised.</p> 

<p>In terms of current land tenure systems in Australia
and New Zealand, the proposal seems a very large step into the
future. There are various practical problems which are discussed
below. However, Bromley and Hodge remind us that nothing is
immutable; "It is important to recognise that the current
assignment of of entitlements in land - and, by extension, in the
policy arena are simply artefacts of previous scarcities and
priorities, and of the location of influence in the political
process. To assume that these entitlements are necessarily
pertinent and socially advantageous to the future is unwarranted.
Shifting values and changing perceptions of the role of agriculture
will surely bring about at least marginal shifts in property rights
and policy entitlements".</p> 
<h3>Practicalities</h3> 
<p>There are a wide range of environmental objectives that need to be addressed anyway. In New
Zealand a system is needed that deals with soil erosion, surface
cover, burning, water quality, water discharge, pesticide use,
noxious weeds, introduced animals and pests, tillage on slopes, and
so on. A similiar list is provided for Australia by Looney (1991).
The incidence of these differ from region to region.</p> 

<p>There is a great deal of scientific work required to establish environmental
standards covering all the objectives. However, it may be that good
practice rules could be derived that substitute for scientific
criteria. There are great differences between point sources of
degradation and non-point sources.</p>

<p>Existing institutional measures use a variety of instruments.
Regulations are used in some areas and incentives in others.
Collective administrative systems conceal the costs of regulatory
and incentive schemes and few comparisions have been made of the
alternatives. It is not clear at this stage which of the "bads"
would be best suited to a polluter pays scheme such as Bromley and
Hodge propose.</p>
<p>The Resource Management Act provides for regional and district
councils to administer land and water and other resource
issues. They will have the responsibility of setting environmental
standards subject to national policy directives. They will have an
obligation to consider all possible instruments and justify their
selection as the most efficient (section 32). Some uniformity would
be assured by consultation with neighbouring jurisdictions.</p>
<p>As it stands therefore the mix of incentives and regulations is
in the hands of the local authorities. A proposal like Bromley and
Hodge's would require more direction from the centre than is
currently the fashion in New Zealand.</p>
<p>These authorities will have to assemble the scientific expertise
they need to determine and monitor the new standards that will be
required. There is already a considerable body of data in the water
quality area. In principle, they could go Bradsen's way and require
conformity to a farm plan of suitable appropriateness; this would
leave open who met the extra costs of compliance though other
ratepayers are likely to have to meet this. Sharing systems for
costs as in pest management could continue. Alternatively, some
authorities could explore polluter pays systems that derive from
the scientific standards yet to be established. Again how this will
affect non-point discharges is not at all clear.</p>
<p>The property rights efficiency analysis does provide some
insight into the rights established under the Torrens system of
land registration. No one has established before that there is a
direct connection between land use practices and the
characteristics of property rights. The Torrens system is very
efficient in doing what it is meant to do - providing absolute
security at low cost. Our respective countries had to be developed
quickly and long term sustainability had not emerged as a problem.
Thus the registration system was designed before the recognition of
technological externalities and hence does not provide any
incentives to right holders to manage an efficient set.</p>

<p>In spite of a lot of discussion in the literature, there is
little evidence of assessment of relative transaction costs of
different right systems. Some of this would be undertaken in
backroom dialogue when respective merits of alternative plans were
thrashed out. This may have to change as the Resource Management
Act (section 32) does require any objective, rule or policy to have
regard to the benefits and costs of the principal alternative means
and effectiveness in achieving the objective or policy. There will
be scope here for considerable discussion of the relevance of
transaction costs and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>Comparisions of the Australian and New Zealand experience show
some similarities and some differences. There are a wide range of
degradation problems to be faced. There are close similarities in
our freehold and leasehold land holding arrangements.</p>
<p>Legislation has been completely updated in recent years.
However, in Australia, controlling legislation is more advanced
than in New Zealand and appears to be running off a different
incentive paradigm than that prescribed in the Resource Management
Act. It may be that NZ local government will be impressed with
the Australian example and adopt the prescriptions advanced by
Bradsen and some state departments (Looney, 1991, p 259).</p>
