Paper presented to the winter meeting of the NZ
Agricultural and Resource Economics Society, Blenheim, 2000.<br>
In New Zealand there has been a gradual process of consolidation in the
structure of the industry in the last 100 years, from 400
cooperative dairies to just a few. In 1999, the last two big
cooperatives, the Kiwi company and the NZ Dairy Co-op, initiated
plans to amalgamate with the NZ Dairy Board, which had statutory
responsibility for overseas marketing. In preliminary negotiations,
it became clear that the merger terms between the companies were
foundering on questions of value and relative performance. This
nine-page paper explores a discounted cash flow model for valuing
the respective contributions of the two companies to the merged
company. Actual cash flows are not explored (due to lack of data)
but the issues involved are discussed [In the event, independent
consultants found that there was insufficient difference in the
prospective cash flows to warrant one company paying an entry fee
into the merger].</li>

<br />This 13-page paper, presented to the NZ Agricultural and Resource Economics Society on
7 July 2001, discusses the Commerce Act legislation in New Zealand and its
provisions for preventing mergers that reduce competition. The
criteria used by the Commission are strictly national interest
criteria based on market dominance theory. The Commission produced
an adverse determination in the case of the merger of the two major
dairy companies in New Zealand and the companies have since resorted to a
direct approach to Government.</li>

<a href="http://users.actrix.co.nz/simonjohnson/rwmj2002c.pdf">(PDF)</a>
<br>Paper presented at the Eighth Annual Conference of the NZ Agricultural and Resource Economics Society
2002 with Ann Anderson.<br>This paper uses Tornqvist index numbers to
estimate total farm productivity trends in NZ for the period
1991-2001. The sample is divided into owner operator farms and
50/50 sharefarmers (the value of milk sales is divided equally
between the land owner and the herd owner). The early 1990s were a
period of rebuilding in the industry and real inputs exceeded real
outputs. Since 1996 the reverse has been true and total
productivity has increased by 3-4% per year.</li>
