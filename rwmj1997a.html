<h1>Organisational Models for Management of Research and Extension:
the Case of New Zealand</h1>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class='abstract'>In the last decade public agricultural research
and extension have been reorganised in New Zealand. The
reorganisation has been driven by fiscal austerity and efficiency
goals as part of a wider reform of government services. In this
reform process there has been a concentration on greater
accountability, financial probity, principal/agent relationships,
divided responsibility, and privatisation (in some cases). In the
agricultural science sector the former state departments have been
replaced by a new structure dividing the functions of funders,
purchasers and providers into separate entities, while extension
services have been transferred successively from a state department
(Agriculture) to a stand-alone bureau, and then sold to a private
company. This paper reviews and analyses the previous government
structures that were found to be unacceptable for both agricultural
science and extension, the structures that were put in their place,
and the organisational models that were explicitly or implicitly
employed in deriving the new structures.</p>

<p class='csmall'>Organisational Models for Management of Research
and Extension: the Case of New Zealand (science.wps)</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The organisation of government services in New Zealand were
previously based on the British Westminster model with a
centralised Parliament and cabinet system supplied by a large
bureaucracy. From the 1930s the degree of government intervention
in economic and social affairs was at an increasing level;
necessitated in New Zealand's case by a dependence on agricultural
exports and imports of manufactures. Economic institutions were
protected from international fluctuations by tariffs and import
controls and internal marketing schemes. At the same time a
comprehensive welfare net was created based on tax-payer funds.
Economic management was centralised and government services reached
into the lives of most people.</p>
<p>Within this historic framework, the provision of science and
extension services was also part of the accepted system. A
Department of Agriculture was established in 1892 to manage and
report on emerging problems of disease control, pests and quality
assurance for the newly discovered refrigerated meat and butter
trade. Over the years the Department expanded to include
agricultural experimentation, export inspection systems, farm
training and extension services. In 1926 a Department of Scientific
and Industrial Research (DSIR) was established to organise science
across all government departments (including some agricultural
science functions previously managed by the Department of
Agriculture-now Ministry of Agriculture (MAF)). These two
departments were state funded, scientists were state employees, and
the structure of command was centralised and autocratic. As part of
the DSIR mandate, however, an additional funding provision was made
to encourage industry research associations on a 50:50 support
basis shared with the industry concerned. In this way relatively
large post-harvest research organisations were established for
dairy products, wool, leather and meat, and an input supply
research organisation for fertiliser research.</p>
<p>Reforms in the science sector as a whole began in 1985 with
instructions to the two departments to introduce charges for
science and extension services and to achieve 2% savings per year
in government funding for the next five years. The aim was to
encourage alternative funding ('commercial revenue targets') (MRST
1992a). In 1989, it was decided to create a Ministry of Research,
Science and Technology (MRST) to take over science policy
functions, and a Foundation for Research, Science and Technology
(FRST) to select and fund research projects which deserved public
support (science purchasers). The operation of science remained in
the old departments temporarily but the existing administrative
funding was divided between the new policy Ministry and the
Foundation. Finally on 1 July 1992, it was decided to reform the
operational or provider side of science as well, and sector
research institutes were established to take over these functions
from the former departments (science providers). Five agricultural
research institutes were created for the pastoral, crop,
horticultural, landcare and water subject areas. The FRST was to
administer a public good science fund (PGSF) with specific criteria
for identifying projects worth funding in the national
interest.</p>
<h2>Old Organisational Models</h2>
<p>The system of science organisation was characterised by public
control, departmental bureaucracy, large scale, multi purpose,
vertically integrated, administratively pluralistic, and long
chains of command (Boston <em>et al</em> 1996) as far the two major
departments were concerned. The research associations were, by
contrast, self-contained, specialised and self governing, and
partially privately funded.</p>
<p>There was a degree of duplication between the two largest
organisations involved, the staff of the two organisations were
dominated by the public service ethic of working hours, holidays,
and retirement provisions, and the results of their efforts were
not sufficiently publicly visible. Departments were funded on a
cash flow and annual appropriation basis with weak reporting
systems to central government (Upton 1995). Accounting systems
emphasised the cost of inputs (wages, salaries and overheads), and
not the cost of results or outputs. Objectives were blurred between
private good and public good science and success was often measured
on the appropriable private good side. Operational research
(support for a department's objectives) was not separately funded
or identified from proper public good research [fundamental or
basic research] and policy advice functions were delivered to
government from within the bureaucracy that provided the science
and extension services (provider capture).</p>
<p>Another perception was that the departments and agencies made
their own priority-setting decisions independently of each other
(MRST 1992a, p.9). There was no common framework for reporting
science activity and expenditure. A common framework was only
introduced in 1990-91 when all the individual science budgets were
amalgamated. Within departments and agencies peer review systems
and publication incentives were said to work well.</p>
<p>From a public choice viewpoint, the science departments, in
common with other departments, were considered to be beset by
self-interest philosophies particularly with regard to working
conditions and lack of public accountability. They also suffered,
in common with others, from long control hierarchies, and specific
to science and extension, dispersed units of service provision. The
long hierarchy generated high overhead costs to all science
provider activities which technically made the science service more
expensive than it need be. Finally, the public service system of
financial management (based on cash flows alone) lead to poor
understanding of relevant costs and benefits of different
activities.</p>
<h2>The Philosophy of Reform</h2>
<p>Public service reform was part of a general plan to reduce the
involvement of government in commerce, and to introduce market
driven methods for the provision of government services (Schwartz
1996, p.l). Some departments with large trading enterprises lent
themselves to privatisation. Other departments were subject to
separation of policy and delivery services, while others were given
less resources to achieve the objectives laid down by Ministers.
All departments were subject to financial reform (Public Finance
Act 1989) which mimic private enterprise disciplines through
accrual accounting methods and demands for positive rates of return
on capital. All departments were also put on arms-length terms with
their Ministers by the imposition of formal contracts between
Minister and CEO, and between CEO and department (State Sector Act
1988).</p>
<p>From a public choice point of view, the reforms can be seen as
endorsing a conservative political agenda (minimising the role of
the state, selling the state's commercial assets, curbing the
functions of government agencies, and maximising liberty-understood
in the limited sense of freedom from state coercion) (Boston <em>et
al</em> 1996, p.18). Further, because politicians can be expected
to abuse their power, it is argued that they should be prevented,
if necessary by constitutional changes, from running budget
deficits or imposing taxes beyond a certain level (Brennan and
Buchanan 1985). Similarly, because departments have a vested
interest in their own survival, they should not tender advice and
implement policy (Treasury 1987, p.75). Otherwise, their advice
will be biased and bureaucratic capture might occur. Finally all
services provided by the state should be made as contestable as
possible (Boston <em>et al</em> 1996, p.18).</p>
<p>The problem of improving performance in a public service is
central to the reforms. The route taken was to introduce
contractual obligations between Minister and CEO that could be
monitored and indeed enforced on occasion. CEOs were employed on
limited period contracts subject to review. This can be seen as an
application of agency theory where the interests of principal and
agent are bound to conflict. Although originally applied to
problems arising from the separation of ownership and control in
firms, it has been much more widely applied. Boston quotes Jensen
and Meckling (1976, p. 309) as follows:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>The problem of inducing an agent to behave as
if he [or she] were maximising the principal's welfare is quite
general. It exists in all organisations and in all cooperative
efforts, at every level of management in firms, in universities, in
mutual companies, in co-operatives, in governmental authorities and
bureaus, and in relationships normally classified as agency
relationships such as are common in the performing arts and the
market for real estate.</p>
<p>In the political realm voters can be regarded as principals who
contract with politicians (their agents) to undertake a range of
tasks and activities on their behalf (Boston <em>et al</em>, p.19,
Moe 1984, p.765):</p>
<p class='blocktext'><q>... the whole of politics can be seen as a
chain of principal-agent relationships, from citizen to politician
to bureaucratic superior to bureaucratic subordinate and on down
the hierarchy of government to the lowest level bureaucrats who
actually deliver services directly to citizens. Aside from the
ultimate principal and the ultimate agent, each actor in the
hierarchy occupies a dual role in which he [or she] serves both as
principal and agent.</q></p>
<p>Now agency theory explains why organisations have difficulty in
meeting their obligations in the real world. Where agents are prone
to shirking, deception, cheating and collusion, obligations are not
met and efficiency is reduced. In bureaucracies, organisations are
slow to respond to political change. As is well known, adverse
selection describes the <!-- Page 4 -->
case where the principal does not have sufficient information about
an agent before agreement is reached. Moral hazard is the case
where the agent's behaviour after agreement cannot be monitored or
anticipated. These deficiencies lead to incomplete information in a
relationship, asymmetrical information and greater uncertainty. The
application to bureaucracy lies in better specification of what is
to be achieved, output-based reward systems, more direct incentives
and better monitoring systems.(Boston <em>et al</em> 1996,
p.19).</p>
<p>A related problem concerns the comparative costs of planning,
adapting and monitoring task completion under alternative
governance structures (Williamson 1985, p.2). Rational agents
should select governance structures that minimise their aggregate
production and transaction costs. The application of this
transaction cost theory is to the practice of contracting out
particular services. External contracting is best when behavioural
uncertainty is low, and the risks of adverse selection are
minimised; when the quantity of the desired goods and services can
be easily measured and thus monitored; and when the number of
potential suppliers is large (Boston <em>et al</em> 1996, p.
24).</p>
<p>An organisational theory that pertains more to science
organisations is the administrative doctrine concerning inclusive
versus divided responsibility. Inclusive or &lsquo;single roof
organisations&rsquo; favour horizontal and/or vertical integration
of activities so as to facilitate unified political responsibility,
better policy coordination, and lower transaction costs. Divided
responsibility organisations minimise conflicts of interest,
minimise bureaucratic capture, reduce the concentration of power,
enhance the clarity of the organisational mission and facilitate
contestable provision (Boston <em>et al</em> 1996, p.75).</p>
<p>Managerialism (Hood 1990, Aucoin 1990) embraces the ideas that
the public sector can be managed like the private sector; that
results are more important than the process; that the
disaggregation of large bureaucratic structures into
quasi-autonomous agencies improves accountability and efficiency;
that public services should be contracted out; that tightly
specified contracts and time scales produce better results; and
that the use of private sector management practices such as
strategic plans, performance agreements, mission statements,
performance-linked remuneration systems, and corporate management
information systems are preferable.</p>
<h2>Science Reform</h2>
<p>The objective of reform was increased accountability, fiscal
savings, and better outcomes for society. This was to be achieved
by privatisation (extension), or by organisational forms that
avoided bureaucratic capture and set tighter goals for performance
(agricultural science). Performance could be enhanced by
contestability for public science contracts, tighter organisational
structures, tighter remuneration systems, and removal of the vast
load of bureaucratic overheads including layers of administrators.
As state-owned enterprises, research institutes became subject to
private sector financial disciplines including returning a dividend
to their owners. Needless to say, these changes involved a
considerable degree of hardship and adjustment particularly in the
number of total jobs available in the short term. Fiscal savings
were also seen as an incentive to gain greater private investment
in research. This objective was aided by stricter monitoring of
public good spending through FRST criteria for selection of public
good projects and programmes.</p>
<p>One observer has stated that science represented perhaps the
strictest application of the functional model in all the reforms
(Boston <em>et al</em> 1996, p.83). There is a formal split between
the roles of funder, purchaser, and provider; MRST is essentially a
single purpose policy ministry; FRST purchases scientific research
via a competitive bidding process from a series of CRIs, tertiary
institutions, and private providers and monitors the performance of
providers; the monitoring of the Crown's ownership interest in the
CRrs is carried out by the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit
(CCMAU); and only FRST has a dual policy advice [limited],
purchasing and monitoring role. Strictly speaking, FRST allocates a
fixed annual fund, but operational research within remaining
departments is often contracted out by them in a purchase framework
also (King 1996).</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<p><i>Objectives</i>. <q>There is agreement that the new system has
provided better focus for the whole science system</q> (Upton 1995,
Devine 1995).</p>
<p><q>The science reforms have encouraged a cultural change among
scientists and end- users. The highly mission-oriented business
culture of the 1990s, coupled with growing end-user focus of the
research community, have given research a significant role in
underpinning international competitiveness</q> (Devine 1995).</p>
<!-- Page 5 -->
<p>The public good emphasis has given a better understanding of
where the public interest lies. <q>Clear, well thought out policy
guide-lines are needed ... relevance only has meaning within the
ideas of public returns to New Zealand ... higher priority should
be given to programmes which, as presented, and at envisaged
funding levels, are expected to give the best marginal return
measured in appropriate social, environmental or economic value
systems</q> (Devine 1995).</p>
<p><i>Funding</i>: By 1994, some significant shifts in the
distribution of research expenditure had occurred. Compared with
the position in 1986, private sector expenditure barely increased
in nominal terms and public expenditure only increased by 22% in 7
years (Table I). Public funding for agricultural research increased
by 27%. Data for universities is not comparable (see note to
table).</p>

<p><i>Crowding Out</i>: The public/private split varies widely
across output classes (Table 2). Private funding is dominant in
primary product processing [the research associations], materials
and engineering, and infrastructural areas. The Universities
dominate social science, health and fundamental research; and the
public sector dominates primary production and the environment.
These allocations reflect the teaching and training role of the
universities and the particular output classes where public funding
is needed because appropriability is lower.</p>

<p>The main implication of the tables is that overall private
sector funding had not increased to the extent that the reforms
desired in the period covered. There appears to be no greater
involvement of business in research funding and rather less support
for theories of' crowding out' by excessive public involvement
(MRST 1992b, p.15). In terms of GDP growth, total funding levels
had also fallen behind, and in real terms there was an absolute
decline in resources made available. These trends appear to confirm
the long term decline in support for science activities noted in
one public report (MRST 1992a, p.9).</p>
<p>There are difficulties in getting greater private involvement.
One agricultural research institute reports: <q>While revenue [in
1995] remained almost static, it increased slightly from new and
expanded relationships with commercial interests .... non-PGSF
sources represent the greatest long term opportunities for the
growth of AgResearch. Revenue from commercial sources is expected
to increase significantly in the years ahead, as commercial
organisations, seek new agri-technologies and bio-technologies to
exploit the opportunities offered under GATT and other liberal
trade agreements</q> (AgResearch Annual Report 1995). In looking to
the future, Devine (1995) observes <q>the ultimate test is whether
end-users and government become sufficiently convinced of the value
of research benefits, [that] they increase their level of
commitment</q>.</p>
<!-- Page 6 -->
<p>Down-sizing: Since 1992, there have been widespread redundancies
in some specialised areas in the CRIs. In 1995- 96, it is estimated
that staff losses were 4% of total staff numbers but other
recruitment was taking place. This has serious implications for the
loss of experienced staff and the corporate memory (King 1996). The
PGSF has only been increased by small nominal amounts since 1992
hence this trend is likely to continue.</p>
<p>Efficiency: The pastoral CRI reported modest profits in 1995,
but noted that its investment of $48m in freehold land and
buildings was substantially greater than is appropriate for a
technology based organisation (AgResearch 1995). Most CRIs had the
advantage of shedding layers of head office staff and offices
located in urban real estate areas. Some could making savings from
the removal of low quality and ill-directed projects which did not
suit their new missions (Devine). Savings were not achieved in the
transfer of priority setting from a departmental basis to a
funder/purchaser/provider basis. The transaction costs of these
activities have actually increased particularly with regard to
providers' (scientists) time and energy (Upton 1995, p.4. )(King
1996).</p>
<p>Some reform would be desirable in the way bidding costs are
shared (Pearce 1995). He suggests a more equitable sharing between
purchaser and provider. Reconsideration of the process could reduce
transaction costs. 'An integrated package of process changes is
needed to move the science purchasing and delivery system from what
can be thought of as a quality control mode to a quality management
mode'.</p>
<p>Autonomy: In anticipation of transition problems, and in
recognition of the need to give CRIs some autonomy in funding,
Government arranged for some of the previous public funding [about
10%] to be allocated to the CRIs outside the PGSF system (CRI
report, ch. 22). This is called non-specific output funding (NSOF).
This would allow a CRI to work independently of the priorities set
by FRST and could include preparatory research to establish the
viability of an idea, support for research teams without public
funding provision, and fellowships and the like.</p>
<p>This can be seen as an exception to the purchaser/provider model
and recognises the uncertain nature of the scientific process and
mind (Upton 1995, p.4.). 'In the absence of large alternative
research funders ... [like philanthropic trusts] it seemed to me
prudent to leave some funding in the hands of research providers as
an insurance policy against purchaser/government failure'. Another
special fund was established to provide research opportunities to
extremely capable scientists whose retention was in the national
interest but whose interests did not fit in with any established
funding category [the Marsden Fund]. As the Minister states 'it is
a response to the particular nature of the process of scientific
enquiry rather than an <i>application of institutional theory</i>'!
The universities particularly welcomed this development (McCutcheon
1995, p.19).</p>
<p>Universities: The universities are an important part of the
science sector (Table 1). They dominate basic research and social
science research expenditure (Table 2). Initially they were left
out of the PGSF discussions because of disagreement over the share
of funds they would have to give up out of V ote:Education, their
main source of funding. University research is funded implicitly by
a component of the Vote: Education block grant, by grants and
contracts obtained from government departments, funding agencies
and industry, by commercial activities and by scholarships awarded
to research students (CRI report, ch. 28).</p>
<p>A small contribution to the PGSF was agreed in 1993, and this
opened access to public good funding for university research.
Nevertheless, one writer says that this only represents 10% of
research funding in his university (McCutcheon 1995, p.18). There
are problems for universities in this kind of organisation of
research. If research is undertaken for the primary purpose of
completing a degree, it is seen as teaching-related research which
should be funded out of Vote: Education; if the primary purpose of
the research is to produce a public good science output then it is
classified as public good research or non-teaching research with
consequent access to PGSF (McCutcheon, p.18). The latter is an
obvious source of support for PhD candidates if they can survive
the bidding process! Since public good funding covers professional
time, university staff awarded contracts find themselves in
conflict with their employers who think that they are paid to
teach. If the best researchers concentrate on research, the burden
of teaching falls on less qualified staff and so on. Further, some
support for research in universities is on a direct cost basis,
with the University covering the overheads; the PGSF system
undermines these donors. McCutcheon believes that user pays system
is inimical to true university research objectives based on
intellectual curiosity, training and disciplinary research (ibid,
p.19).</p>
<p>Aricultural Research and Extension: The extension activity was
always the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture. There
was no sharing with the universities as in other countries. In
1987, the Ministry (as it then was) <!-- Page 7 -->
amalgamated its research and extension bureaus, both to save costs
and overheads and to seek possible synergies (Ritchie 1995, p.3).
Then in 1991, the two were separated again: research services to be
split among the CRIs, and extension services to be formed into a
publicly-owned trading enterprise. In 1995, this enterprise was
sold to a private firm. On the 4-year synergy experiment, Ritchie
says</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"strong regional autonomy helped establish
local initiatives early in the commercialisation process, but at
the time prevented the development of a national business ethic ...
the culture of a research organisation is different from a truly
commercial organisation ... research culture is driven by
innovation and product development while the consultancy culture is
market driven and one of client service" (ibid, p.3).</p>
<p>On the commercialisation issue, the government took the view
(under Treasury advice) that extension services were not public
goods at all, and government has no need to support such a service.
This is a debatable issue especially where the public good content
of information services, field demonstrations and policy servicing
are concerned, As Ritchie reports, his commercial organisation has
had to down-size and concentrate its activities on one-to-one
extension advice, sub-contracting to the science providers,
training services and advice to agribusiness (Ritchie, p.5).
Sub-contracting to the science providers involves field
experimentation and technology transfer. This kind of interaction
has considerable potential (King). The new divided responsibilities
for technology transfer have left a gap compared with the old
public service system. New ideas and organisational skills are
needed in this area (King 1996, Ritchie 1995). The status of
technology transfer could be enhanced by identifying it as a
separate outcome in the PGSF, instead of disguising it as part of
an individual output (King).</p>
