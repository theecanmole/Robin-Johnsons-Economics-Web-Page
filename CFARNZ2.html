<h1>Contestable Funding in Agricultural Research in New Zealand.</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2> 
<p>Since 1991 the New Zealand government has moved from a departmental form of organisation for government-funded science to a corporate model where science institutes and others compete for the available funds on a projectby project basis. The government embraced this organisational reform because its key advisors had a strong belief that government funding dominated private or business funding and hence discouraged private entities from engaging in R&D investment. The solution was to disestablish the large government departments engaged in R&D and to create ten subject matter research institutes which would have to bid for the previous funding that was available through their government appropriations. At the same time, the newly formed institutes were directed to seek alternative funding wherever possible and thus reduce their dependence on the state. Under this plan, the agricultural research activities of the Ministry of Agriculture were split up among four of the ten institutes to deal with animal research, plant research, water research and land research. Each institute also inherited some functions from the disbanded Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In the fifteen years since these reforms these agriculturally-oriented institutes have lost shares in the funding game. This paper discusses the intentions of the reforms  and the subsequent history of funding for agricultural R&D public investment in New Zealand.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>New Zealand was annexed by the British crown in 1840 following some small scattered settlements, the arrival of missinaries, and a considerable invasion of whalers and adventurers on its verdant shores. The new settlements established following annexation slowly built up a local economy based on selling timber to passing ships and a small wool industry. The invention  of refrigeration in the 1870s transformed the local economy (and that of Australia and the Argentine for that matter) by promoting the development of an export trade in meat and dairy products to world markets. From such small beginnings has grown a thriving economy of first world status that supports a population of 4 million people. New Zealand is still a member of the British Commonwealth but is otherwise a self-governing parliamentary democracy.</p>    

<p>The agricultural economy is based on farming European breeds of sheep and cattle in a generally favourable climatic environment and in areas of good soils and aspect. By the end of the nineteenth century it was apparent that the uncontrolled introduction of pests and diseases was a threat to the developing agricultural economy. This triggered the establishment of regulations in the then Department of Agriculture and a positive attitude towards scientific measures of control and agricultural research. Over the years, the Department of Agriculture (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1972) grew into a multifunctional administrative department with bureaus involved in policy advice, meat hygiene, dairy quality control, basic research, veterinary medicine, and extension.</p> 
<p>Early in the 1920s, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) was established to coordinate basic research across the country with some overlap with MAF in the plant and animal sciences but with more specialisation in geology, soils, forensics, industry, and physics. The two departments controlled several large science campuses which became well-known in science circles around the world (Ruakura, Invermay, Lincoln and Grasslands). The 1920 reforms suggested greater involvement and cooperation with the five main universities then established, but this was largely left unimplemented due to shortages of funding and administrative convenience.  This paper is concerned with the transformation of these two departments of state into a number of modern corporate self-governing research institutes and the introduction of contestable funding of public money devoted to research imvestment.</p>

<h2>The re-organisation of the science system in New Zealand</h2> 

<p>In the whole post world war II period, scientific research was largely government funded and conducted on government controlled research campuses. This dominance  typified the historical development of a new country like New Zealand with a preponderance of small producers selling agricultural exports into uncertain world markets. There were problems in hygiene, pest control, soil minerals, plant and animal breeding and soil conservation that needed fairly urgent and detailed attention. In the different subject areas, government was more dominant in primary industry and environmental matters, the universities in social sciences and fundamental research, and the private sector in manufacturng, construction and communications research.</p> 

<p>From 1984, a change in Government leadership started a process of re-examining the structure of government departments and state-supported agencies. Agricultural support prices were suspended and industrial protection scaled down. Post office services, television, and communications were shifted to a company basis known as state-owned enterprises with the majority of shares held by Ministers of the Crown. Telecom New Zealand was later fully privatised as were rail and air services. In this heady mixture, the reform of science services took longer to accomplish and was not completed until 1991.</p>

<p>In line with other reforms, the structure of public science was reorganised to move from a departmental model to a company-based private sector model of organisation, though remaining owned by the Crown. At the same time, the public funding systems were changed from the existing departmental vote allocations for science work to a bidding system administered by a special agency - The Foundation for Research, Science and Technology (FRST). The departmental advice units on science were abolished and a new agency created to coordinate science policy - The Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST).</p>      

<p>The goal of the reforms was to seek greater efficiencies in the allocation of public funds to R&D endeavour. There was a perception among officials that public science tended to 'crowd out' private endeavour and that departmental organisations were cumbersome, self-interested and lacked direction. Indeed, in this period, public choice economics was influential and experimentation with the institutions of the state was very permissive.  This was especially true of the science reorganisation (Boston et al 1996). The result of these forces was a movement toward specialist private delivery organisations funded from a competitive funding base. After the reforms, MoRST and FRST were to be subject to the New Public Management model with emphasis on the separation of funder, purchaser, and provider roles (op cit, p.26).</p>

<p>Prior to 1990, public science administration was dominated by the DSIR and MAF<sup>1</sup>. These departments operated under the Vote system receiving annual appropriations from central government. They employed staff, ran research campuses and determined their own scientific objectives. There was broad agreement on areas of specialisation though some duplication did occur. Central oversight was weak although there were a number of advisory bodies in place in the 1960s and 1970s. The National Research Advisory Council (NRAC) operated from 1963 to 1986 and proffered advice to central government and was succeeded by the Science and Technology Advisory Committee until 1992.</p> 

<p>The Department of Agriculture administered an extension service for farmers and horticulturalists which provided advice on a free basis. These structures had a number of similarities to the structures in Australian states and had also borrowed from USA extension models. Outside the departmental system were a number of industry research associations for dairy products (DRI), wool research (WRONZ), meat research (MRINZ), and fertiliser research which were partially funded by government but owned and controlled by the respective industry organisations.</p> 

<p>Reorganisation of the departments took the form of establishing 10 new research institutes registered as private companies but under Crown ownership. These were based on subject matter titles e.g. Agricultural Research, Crop and Food, Horticulture, Forestry, Water and Atmospherics, Industrial Research, Land Care Research, Environmental Science, and Geological and Nuclear Science. An Institute of Social Science was mooted but later dropped. Each institute had its own board of directors, appointed by government, and managed its own assets. Ownership remained with the government, represented by two shareholding ministers, the Minister for Crown Research Institutes and the Minister of Finance.</p> 

<p>The Departmental appropriations were passed to MoRST and FRST to administer. As far as FRST is concerned, 'The Foundation's main roles are to invest public funds in research and development, provide independent policy advice on science and technology to government and encourage technological innovation' (NZ Yearbook 1993, p.291).  The Public Good Research Fund (PGSF) was established to receive bids from government departments, Crown funded agencies, research associations, universities, private companies and individuals, non-profit private trusts, incorporated societies and state owned enterprises that conduct public good research. The agencies and organisations competed to win contracts to undertake agreed research programmes, which reflect national science priorities. The Foundation was required to work alongside the private sector to increase their involvement in research and development. The Technology for Business Growth Programme (TBG), for example, invested in research and technological development business projects conducted jointly between business and research institutions. There was also a Research Associate programme, funded by the Foundation, to encourage young scientists to further their work in specific areas of priority research either in a research institution or in industry.</p>

<p>Thus a state model of public research, common to other countries in the British Commonwealth, was converted to a company-based private model of organisation in line with the precepts of Public Choice and the New Public Management. The new organisation split agriculture research between several crown research institutes (Agriculture, Crops, Landcare and Horticulture) and the extension service was sold to private enterprise.</p>  

<p>In terms of the new public management constructs, the NZ government reforms of the 1980s showed a general preference for:</p><ul>
<li>private over public organisations (especially for commercial functions);</li>
<li>non-departmental organisations over ministerial departments (especially for policy  implementation rather than advice);</li>
<li>small scale over large scale organisations;</li>
<li>single-purpose over multi-purpose organisations;</li> 
<li>pluriform over uniform administrative structures;</li> 
<li>divided over inclusive responsibility (ie the separation of policy and operations, the separation of funder, purchaser and provider, the separation of operations and regulation, the separation of provision and review/audit, the separation of commercial and non-commercial, and the separation of responsibilities for monitoring the Crown's ownership interests and its purchase interests);</li>
<li>multi-source over single-source supply;</li>
<li>like with like (primarily on the basis of purpose or the kind of service);</li>
<li>short hierarchies;</li>
<li>straight-line accountabilities (ie the avoidance of multiple principals); and</li>
<li>decentralised administration for the delivery of services.   (Boston et al 1996)</li></ul>

<p>These authors point out that the formal institutional separation of policy  and operations (and, where relevant, the separation of funder, purchaser and provider roles) has been implemented to a greater extent in areas like defence, environmental administration, health care, housing, justice, and scientific research, than in areas like labour, police, and social welfare. They believe the strictest application of the functional model was in the area of scientific research.  In this area there was a formal split between the roles of funder, purchaser and provider; the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology was essentially a single-purpose policy ministry; while the Foundation for Research Science and Technology was to purchase scientific research via a competitive bidding process from a series of CRIs, tertiary institutions and private providers, and monitor the performance of providers. The monitoring of the Crown's ownership interest in the CRIs was to be carried out by the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU). Although the Ministry was the government's chief advisor on science policy, FRST was also funded to provide policy advice, thus emerging with multiple advisory, purchasing, and monitoring roles (Boston et al, p.83).</p>  

<p>In such a reorganisation, there was inevitably a loss of institutional memory in the old government departments and a loss of jobs in that quarter. Scientists were less discomforted by the administrative changes as far as job security was concerned but subsequently faced increased insecurity of tenure as the bidding rounds changed priorities and moved away from some traditional sacred cows. Job security was maintained in the extension service by offering employment in the privatised company though many chose not to take advantage of it. As far as setting priorities is concerned, a single agency was an advantage and a single funding agency was in position to organise a more coherent framework for the selection of projects and programmes.</p>  

<h2>Who Does What? International Comparisions</h2>

<p>In New Zealand  total  research expenditure has been being maintained at around one per cent of GDP for some years. With the reforms that have just been discussed, a declining share of expenditure has been under government aegis (Table 1). Even so, Government sources still fund over 50 per cent of that total. Private business has been taking on an increasing share as the reformers desired.</p>

<p>However, the research interests believe that a national investment of only one per cent of GDP is a national disgrace and quote information from other OECD countries of similar size that invest double that amount in R&D (Table 2).  New Zealand ranks very low among the reference countries quoted in the source. Over the whole of the OECD sample of 31 countries in 2004,  New Zealand was ranked 21st for business R&D expenditure, 24th for higher education expenditure but 7th for government expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP. The countries with even higher government investment in the reference year were Iceland (0.74), France (0.36), Finland (0.34), Germany (0.34), Australia (0.33) and Korea (0.33). The research community believes these ratios are a measure of performance between countries (MoRST 2006). Such reasoning does not make economic sense to this author, who would seek reasons in the area of rates of return on R&D investment and in the over-provision of some services by the state.</p>

<p>In the source publication, the authors question whether New Zealand needs to reach the OECD average for R&D performance (MoRST 2006, p.21). They suggest that NZ should be expected to spend less because of the small size of the economy, the lack of large manufacturing firms, the existing role of the CRIs and the universities, the inward flow of R&D by multinational firms, the lack of high technology industries such as aerospace, defence or automotive industries, and the dependence on primary production. On the other hand, the research providers consistently state that the overall investment is too low and the government could contribute more to R&D activity.</p>

<p>From the government point of view, it is clear that budget decisions have consistently lowered the government share of R&D investment in terms of GDP growth. This pattern follows the policy decisions taken in the 1990s where the burden was to be shifted to the private sector. Thus there remains a gap between the aspirations of the research industry (or the more vocal members of it) and the fiscal authorities. In my view, this cannot be readily resolved because of the lack of agreement between the parties on what the problem is and where the priorities lie.  There is room for disagreement because of inadequate measures of the rate of return on R&D investment project by project, portfolio by portfolio, as well as the uncertainty that surrounds the outcomes of  the research programmes currently being funded. The FRST decision processes appear to work by a list of qualitative criteria whose final results can only approximate to a full analytical ranking consistent with rate of return studies. The decision makers have to work with the best information they have.</p>

<h2>Project selection by rules</h2>

<p>As the decision-making organisation, FRST has to rank the bids for public research funds. FRST receives Ministerial directions from time to time as to how they are to administer funds made available under a particular Government approved programme. In addition they would be in a position to develop house rules of their own to guide its staff. These decisions would require an information base, skilled staff and evaluators which an organisation like FRST  would have in place. The whole process uses the language of public management planning and  identifies outcomes, outputs and research portfolios in its documentation.</p>

<p>For example, FRST has an 'output class' called 'research for industry' a $205m research programme in 2004. The outcome or goal sought is stated as `public good research, science and technology that increases the competitiveness of New Zealand industries and sectors' (MoRST 2004). The 'outputs' identified are:</p>
<ul><li>'Research whose primary objective is to advance food and fibre-based  industries and related sectors through innovation. Research portfolios will lead to new products, processes and services that enhance the competitiveness of these industries and sectors;</li>
<li>Research whose primary objective is to advance manufacturing and services industries and sectors through innovation. Assists manufacturing and services industries and sectors to innovate, and includes research on the broad factors affecting business and economic life;</li>
<li>Research for the development of infrastructure to underpin economic development. Assists infrastructure services , such as communications, energy, water and waste, to innovate  cost-effectively. It also includes research on New Zealand's mineral wealth and understanding of, and responses to risks faced from New Zealand's physical hazards; and</li>
<li>Research consortia to facilitate public/private research partnerships that provide early user engagement  and increase private investment  in New Zealand . Research investment will be made through user-led research consortia in partnership with research providers'.</li></ul>   

<p>The Government then provides in the Direction a description of the rules it would expect in administering the programme: 'As it invests, the Foundation will give priority to portfolios of research that meet the following criteria:'</p>
<ul>
<li>scientific and technological quality;</li>
<li>potential benefit to New Zealand  through innovation;</li>
<li>contribution to boosting competitiveness of New Zealand industries and sectors; or contribution to developing a robust infrastructure to underpin economic development;</li>
<li>clearly defined partnerships and pathways to implementation of the research outcomes; and</li>
<li>potential to build scientific and technological capability and to increase the level of innovation within user groups.(ibid).</li></ul>

<p>There are a wide number of such outputs spread between the four goals. There is thus a hierarchy of outcomes, outputs and approved research portfolios. There is no specific mention of rates of return to the nation  except for the instruction to take account of potential benefit  to New Zealand through innovation'<sup>2</sup>.  One output class is concerned with the development of infrastructure which also includes an understanding of and response to risks faced from New Zealand's physical hazards. At this level, there is no specific indication of the risks or uncertainty that the proposed research investments posess. There is thus  a weak emphasis on economic criteria in favour of priority rules suitable for use at administrative levels.</p>

<p>If a financial risk analysis is not possible in the circumstances, then presumably  a social optimum might be achieved by way of expert committees and house rules? It would then be possible to talk about the aggregate selection and choice of projects providing the best social rate of return. However, the views of the agricultural research interests are opposed to such a conclusion as they argue that their projects have been discriminated against throughout the process. Some possible reasons for this are discussed at the end of the next section.</p>     

<h2>Investment in Agricultural R&D</h2>

<p>Since 1992, FRST has organised the review of bids for public good research funds and appointed advisory committees in various subject areas. After a few rounds, the desire for greater private investment and a suspicion of traditional industry manifested itself in a considerable reduction in agricultural research allocations, particularly in animal industry and forage crops.</p> 

<p>In the years up to 1999, public good science effort was categorised by 'industry output areas', defined as areas where major beneficiaries were located<sup>3</sup>.  Total public good funding of investment proposals was published in terms of these classifications (See Table 3). Of the 19 'output areas', four could be clearly classified as 'agricultural research'; animal research, dairy research, forage and crops, and horticultural crops research. The extent of the subtle shift in funding over the years from 1993 to 1999 by the contestable funding system can be seen in the decline in agricultural research outputs' share of public good funding from 46 per cent to 42 per cent, with only dairy research actually bettering its share of resources.  This data was discontinued after 1999. It should be noted that the above 'output areas' do not exactly follow the same boundaries as those of the research institutes, and also include private providers and the universities (i.e. all sucessful applicants for public funds in these categories).</p>

<p>Examining the same proposition from the point of view of the Crown Research Institutes, the agricultural CRIs received a diminishing share of the the total public good funds made available through the contestable bidding process (Table 4). In the long run, there has been a gradual shift from public funding to private funding of CRIs.  From 1993 to 2004, non-governmental funding rose from 37 percent of total revenue to 54 per cent across all institutes (Johnson et al 2006). Of these total funds, the agricultural CRIs' share fell slightly from 55 per cent to 52 per cent. Their share of public good funds fell from 59 per cent to 50 percent, and as a result of these two trends, agricultural public good funding  fell from 37 per cent of all funding to 23 per cent. This confirms the trends shown up in the 'output areas' analysis in Table 3.</p> 

<table align="center" class='c4'>

<p>This scenario is the result of the cumulative effect of FRST administrative processes rather than a deliberate government policy instruction. CRIs were instructed to find alternative sources of income, administrators were told to involve the private sector to a greater extent. Private sector assistance was expanded and funds made available. 'Agriculture' was suspect because it had previously received the greatest public support for many years. However, there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate whether the new allocation of funds is a better outcome than it was was previously. Reasons for the decline in agricultural shares of public investment in R&D include:</p>
<ul><li>a common belief that agriculture is an 'old industry' and support should be going to 'new' industries;</li> 
<li>the move from production output area goals to broader goals;</li>
<li>constraints on public funding;</li>
<li>the movement away from public providers of appropriable (profit-earning) research;</li> 
<li>a shift away from output areas where public good funding was 'too dominant':</li> 
<li>the desire for 'complementary' or supporting funding to the private sector;</li> 
<li>the 'crowding out' belief held in some circles (government activity taking over private sector roles); and</li>
<li>the possible over-application of 'market failure' theory (too much public support for areas of under-investment).</li></ul>

<p>As far as the agricultural interests are concerned, they need to know how to counter these arguments and possible bias in previous project selection and to put forward a positive case for investment in agricultural growth and productivity. The country will benefit most from being able to generate better quality and more efficient products that sell on overseas markets. At present, these predominantly come from farm production.</p>   

<h2>New developments in funding policy</h2>

<p>From the mid 1990s, it was apparent that there was an unconscious drift away from investment in agricultural research. This became evident in the agriculturally-oriented institutes as staff numbers had to be adjusted and some of the older research initiatives modified. On the other hand, the environmentally-oriented institutes expanded their funding as the administrators came under more pressure to respond to government concerns about the health of the environment. Bidders for public good funds also soon complained about the short-term cycles of research planning the contestable system encouraged4. A scientist was quoted as saying </p>

<p class='blocktext'>'the key issue is uncertainty. Once you put in a funding application you don't know for nine months whether or not you are going to be successful. That makes it difficult to plan ahead'.</p>
 
<p>The research establishment was used to long planning horizons under the old system and were able to divert resources to new areas without upsetting staff  security of tenure. Under the contestable system, some well-established projects had to be curtailed and specialist staff diverted to other projects. However, government was slow to respond to requests to modify the contestable system of allocating public resources. </p>

<p>The Association of Scientists expressed the view that there had been inefficient management of RS&T resources (Campbell, Lillis and Grieve, 2005).</p> 

<p>Inefficient management leads to excessive transaction costs on research institutions through the proliferation of funding instruments, along with excessively expensive bidding processes and reporting requirements, in tandem with excessive use of contestability, over-prescription of research and inadequate funding  for excellence-based  curiosity-driven research; lack of clear strategic planning and transparent funding policy around key research areas, thus reducing the ability of research organisations  to plan for the future and fund equipment adequately.</p>

<p>In 2004 discussions between the Government and the research industry started the process of reform. The aim was declared to be to replace short term contestable funding  and move toward long term commitment of resources to individual research providers to plan their own priorities. The agricultural research community in particular has been increasingly vocal on the role it wishes to play and critical of the old contestable fund system.</p> 

<p>To meet some of these problems, government had created in 1994 a top-up fund over and above the public good contracts in the research institutes  to help meet operating costs, pay for non-funded research and retain staff5.  In 2004 CRIs complained that 2004-05 funding of $32.376m was inadequate to retain promising scientists, but funding agencies were concerned that providing money without specifying how it should be used made accountability difficult.  The Budget that year voted an additional $17.8m in new capability funding for CRIs in addition to some other funding increases.</p>
 
<p>The Minister (Mr S Maharey) followed this with a major announcement to make clear that it was now time for less contestability and more annual 'devolved allocations' to CRIs. The methods of allocation would be developed. Research institutes needed sustainable funding  to be able to maintain core competencies, finance capital works, new equipment and address the loss of researchers  and inability to recruit young scientists:.</p> 

<p class='blocktext'>'Contestability is not completely the wrong answer, because it drives innovation, but it went to extremes'.</p> 

<p>He further noted that previously the aim of science policy had been to reduce funding of research of benefit to industry from the public purse, requiring industries and producers  to contribute directly to appropriate Crown research institute research programmes. He also indicated it was time CRI boards were given more of the discretionary roles they were set up for, instead of the funding bodies making all the key decisions.</p>

<p>In a further announcement6, the Minister stated that the government would continue to sustain strong investment in RS&T, particularly on people and resources. The new Capability Fund will replace the former Non-Science Outputs Fund (NSOF), to assist the CRIs to maintain core capabilities. </p>

<p>In another statement, government confirmed that it had moved away from the competitive bidding model for R&D funding toward more long term arrangements with the science providers (MoRST 2005). Government needed to step up from simplistic public choice theory  models of the 1990s.  The needs of the industry were: long-term sustainable investment;  a stable funding environment; support for high performers; a clear and purposeful R&D agenda; enhanced opportunities for collaboration, networking and technology transfer; and RS&T that is valued, trusted and supported by New Zealanders.</p> 

<p>The aim was to provide a clear understanding of critical responsibilities of players in an RS&T system with a focus on core capabilities that deliver benefit to New Zealand so research organisations can manage better for their people and future research priorities. Alongside the multi-year budget package a one-off statement would be developed on the obligations and expectations for sectors. A series of RS&T directions or roadmaps for key science areas would be developed with relevant groups of stakeholders, key users and research organisations. There would be increased emphasis on collaboration and networking (MoRST 2005).</p>

<p>This setting of the scene is reflected in FRST's statement of intent dated April 2005 (FRST 2005a). 'To support the Government's strategies and address the Minister's challenges FRST's strategy focuses on:'</p>
<ul><li>investing in areas that will help achieve measurable target outcomes where RS&T can make a real difference in improving wealth and wellbeing;</li>
<li>investing in a manner that encourages improved performance in achieving these outcomes including greater devolution  of decision making to RS&T providers;</li>
<li>evaluating and bench marking performance to support making the right investment choices to reinforce and reward good performance; </li>
<li>enhancing the Foundation's role as facilitator of an integrated and responsive innovation system</li>.</ul>

<p>In a document about investment signals and requests for proposals on the website (FRST 2005b), the Foundation outlines how it will handle investment proposals for the round starting in July 2007. FRST notes that the Minister wishes to bring greater stability into the funding environment. This will involve reducing contestability in the system by devolving funding and detailed decision making to research organisations although some portfolios funds will be released for investment through fully contestable project rounds. FRST interprets this as investment that is narrower and deeper.</p> 

<p>In summary, the short term system of bidding rounds, project by project, is to be superceded by a system of longer term block grants that devolve project choice on the research providers. Control passes back to the CRIs and other providers who will have prepare their longer term strategies for FRST scrutiny. There does not appear to be, as yet, a concomitant increase in the government vote for RS&T, so the future directions of research may well involve more of the same. Also, the future of agricultural research funding lies with the FRST and not with the CRIs. As will be seen below, a fresh approach needs to be developed that establishes the primacy of agricultural research and the reasons for it. </p> 

<h2>Recent responses from the agricultural research community</h2>

<p>It is clear that agricultural research interests have made their position known to successive Ministers in recent years. There have been submissions from AgResearch, the major research institute, and from Fonterra, the recently formed national dairy cooperative. One key development has been the development of Fonterra's strategic framework for dairy farming's future. The purpose of the framework was to set the strategic direction for all on-farm research, development, extension and education. Fonterra needed to have a plan for increased efficiency that did not compromise economic, environmental and animal welfare imperatives, it was stated (Dairy Insight et al 2005).</p>  

<p>The industry has set a goal of boosting farm productivity by 4 per cent per year. The group has already lobbied Government for a $60m boost to pastoral farming research. The Chairman of Fonterra states that putting resources into 'core' agriculture is a safer bet than some less-established sectors, and that the above sum is a relatively small amount of money given the potential economic benefits to the country (The Dominion Post, 28.9.05). The CEO stated that the company wanted a more efficient model that makes sense for all parties involved. It wanted to avoid as much duplication in the farming sector as possible and to ensure the company was not burdened with spending money on research that does not directly benefit its value-added goals.</p> 

<p>Not to be outdone, AgResearch announced in November 2005, that it needed $73m for buildings alone. Dr West argued that the extra $60m for the dairy industry should go straight to the crown research institutes who will then decide what to spend it on. He also argued that farmers' contributions to research investment should rise too: </p>

<p class='blocktext'>'The $10m they contribute in levies is not much when you consider farm gate returns are $6 billion'.</p>  

<p>AgResearch's strategic plan for the next 15 years was based on the country investing in its core strengths, the husbandry of plants and animals, he said. </p>

<p>Taken with Government showing a willingness to increase devolved funding to the CRIs there is now a marked willingness in the agricultural research sector to expand their research activities over the static levels recorded above. The agricultural research lobby has increased its public relations effort and has started to put significant research programs in front of government for public good spending. Private participation will be needed as well. While the Minister talks of investing 3 per cent of GDP (a trebling) in future years, marked increases in research spending by the government or the private sector are likely to emerge more slowly in terms of this measure.</p>       

<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>

<p>The last 15 years in New Zealand has seen a significant experiment undertaken with regard to the organisation of R&D services. There has traditionally been a fairly even split of resources between the government providers, private sector providers and university providers. Before the 1990 reforms, some commentators were of the view that the government sector was too dominant and had been creating a 'crowding-out' effect on the private sector. The erstwhile aim of the reforms was to increase private participation and to decrease the influence of the large government departments and the funding drain on the government. To this end, 10 research companies were set up to absorb the science roles of all government departments.  To finance the new structures, the former departmental appropriations were placed in a government pool - known as the Public Good Science Fund (PGSF) - for allocation to all research providers on a bidding basis.</p> 

<p>Since the reforms began national spending on science has kept pace with gross domestic product (GDP).  In terms of provider spending there has been an increase in the share of research being performed by the private sector and the universities and a decline in the share conducted by government agencies. In terms of overall funding, there has been a parallel increase from the private sector and a decline in the government share. These changes were predicated by the reforms in the first place and could be said to have achieved what the planners set out to do. It is not clear whether this is a better outcome.</p>

<p>Agricultural research before the reforms absorbed about one third of all resources made available. Going by the spending by the agricultural crown institutes (Ag Research, Crop & Food Research, HortResearch and Landcare) the share of CRI resources going to agricultural research has almost been maintained (55 per cent in 1993-94 and 52 per cent in 2004-05). At the same time, the share of agricultural research funded by the government has fallen from 59 per cent to 50 per cent.</p> 

<p>There has been criticism of the funding mechanisms and the rules which were used to choose successful projects. As a result, the government issued in 2005 the outlines of a new system of public good research funding which would be based on longer-term contracts with the research providers and devolving more of the individual project choice to them also. This development is a return to the ways of the 1970s and 1980s when the two large departments were in sole charge of spending priorities for the public good science money.</p> 

<p>Nevertheless, there has been a resurgence in the agriculture research sector since 2005. The major participants like AgResearch, Fonterra, Dexcel and Dairy Insight have produced a series of reports on future developments, particularly for the dairy sector, which envisage both increased private spending and an increased contribution from the government. The industry sees all the animal and forage industries working together for the common good and with an increased commitment from public funds.</p>

<p>It remains clear that the public purse is to be kept tightly controlled for the immediate future and all the research interests will have to either fund more research themselves or find new sources of support. For the agricultural sector the need is to continue to present arguments based on the close relationship between innovation and export growth.  New Zealand remains dependent on a few key internationally traded primary products which, because of the distance from markets, have to be produced and shipped at lower prices than other temperate agricultual exporters.</p>
