<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Various episodes of <i>Yes Minister</i> and <i>Yes Prime Minister</i> may
have inured us to the machinations of the Permanent Secretary in
Her Majesty's Government, but a deeper message lies within the
economics of public choice and bureaucracy. The process of
government has profound effects on the kinds of economic policies
that emerge from democratic governments and how they are
implemented.</p>


<p>Political decision making in the economic sphere involves a balancing of
views of different interests to find some common denominator. The
final decision in a given case is likely to be influenced by those
who bear the costs and those who share the benefits of the policy
decision. This article suggests that the transaction costs involved
in the political process itself are also important.</p>

<p>Public choice economics has focused attention on many parts of the political
process such as the role of constitutions, the use of rules, the
earning of economic rents, principal-agency relationships and
capture of independent government-owned organisations by interest
groups. The meeting place where these issues are resolved is known
in public choice circles as the <q>political market</q>. The political
market can be seen as the collective expression of individual and
group preferences through an aggregate decision-making process, the
governmental polity.<a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym" id=
"sdfootnote1anc"><sup>1</sup></a> Less attention has been
paid to the economics of political processes that are used to
formulate economic policy. <q>Transaction cost</q> economics, a branch
of the <q>new institutional economics</q>, has some potential in this
regard which is discussed in this article.</p>

<p>Working from the writings of Buchanan, Williamson, and North, it is possible to
construct a transaction cost model of the political decision
process and its effects on the formation of economic policy. The
model sees politicians and interest groups resolving their
differences by adopting policy measures that suit both parties.
Politicians favour policies which extend the life of the party[ies]
in power while interest groups favour policies which deliver
benefits to them now and in the future. Interest groups are
powerful precisely because they can influence voting patterns and
party finances. Major transaction costs arise from the difficulties
and uncertainties of maintaining control of the process over
time.</p>

<p>In the first part of the article I review recent literature in this area, and
follow that with a discussion of some of the implications for
public policy analysis.</p>

<h2>Transaction cost economics</h2>

<p>Transaction cost economics derives from the work of Ronald Coase who first
posited that when it is costless to transact, the efficient
competitive solution of neoclassical economics
obtains<a class="f" name="sdfootnote2anc" href=
"#sdfootnote2sym" id="sdfootnote2anc"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p> 

<p>It does so because the competitive structure of efficient markets leads the parties to
arrive costlessly at the solution which maximises aggregate income
regardless of the institutional arrangements. But with information
deficiencies and imperfections in input and product markets further
<i>transaction</i> costs are incurred by the firm in the conduct of
its business. It is no longer costless to transact and the
institutional arrangements have a bearing on the outcome as the
base line is no longer the neoclassical solution.</p>

<p>As a result, proponents of the institutional approach therefore focus on
alternative governance structures in firms and ask what are the
<i>net gains</i> after costs of information gathering and
maintaining contracts have been taken into account<a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym" id=
"sdfootnote3anc"><sup>3</sup></a>. The focus is on
organisational alternatives rather than the marginal conditions.
The marginal conditions are seen as some `ideal' benchmark which
can never be achieved in the real world.</p>


<p>This approach is the basis of Oliver Williamson's analysis of hierarchical
organisations and the economics of vertical and horizontal
integration<a class="f" name="sdfootnote4anc"
href="#sdfootnote4sym" id="sdfootnote4anc"><sup>4</sup></a>.
It stresses the role of a number of transaction costs that prevent
the pure model of competition working in an imperfect world. In
particular, costs of maintaining and policing contractual
obligations and asset specificity are the determinants of the final
outcome.</p>

<h2>Government policy formation</h2>
<p>Can this reasoning be applied to government policy-making and organisation?
Douglass North, Murray Horn and Avinash Dixit are among those who
have applied transaction cost economics to political decision
making in the realm of economic policy<sup><a class="f"
name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym" id=
"sdfootnote5anc">5</a></sup>. There is a new recognition
of the role of governance structures in policy making institutions.
In turn, these constructs enable policy formation and
implementation to be identified separately from the political
process of which they are part.</p>

<p>The study of alternative institutional arrangements started with the work of
Coase. He observed that the conventional approach in welfare
economics was to consider an ideal economic system and then
prescribe what is necessary to achieve the ideal. The recognition
of the importance of transaction costs transferred analytic
interest to alternate systems of governance, whether private or
public. Public policy involves a choice between alternative social
institutions, which are created by law or are dependent on it.
Without knowledge of what could be achieved under alternative
institutional arrangements, it is impossible to choose wisely among
them<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote6anc" href=
"#sdfootnote6sym" id="sdfootnote6anc">6</a></sup>.</p>


<p>This approach
is consistent with classical economics where the primary objective
of political economy was to contrast alternative political and
frameworks in order that choice among these institutional
arrangements might be better informed<sup><a class="f"
name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym" id=
"sdfootnote7anc">7</a></sup>. The economist following
the Pigouvian approach in the analysis of market failure problems
is likely to prescribe government action where none is warranted
because the method has an implicit bias toward interventionist
solutions<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote8anc" href=
"#sdfootnote8sym" id="sdfootnote8anc">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The US economist Pasour reasons that the Pigouvian approach is flawed
precisely because it ignores transaction costs. If one explores
many actual exchange situations it is soon found that they are
characterised by imperfect markets, deficiencies of information and
unequal bargaining power. As Avinash Dixit puts it: <q>As a crude but
effective caricature, one can say that normative policy analysis
began by supposing that the policy was made by an omnipotent
(having infinite power), omniscient (infinite knowledge), and
benevolent dictator. The work on second best removed the
omnipotence. That on information removed the omniscience. However,
the assumptions of benevolence and dictatorship have remained
unaffected by all these improvements in our understanding of the
limits on instruments and information....In reality, a policy
proposal is merely the beginning of a process that is
<i>political</i> at every stage - not merely the process of
legislation, but also the implementation, including the choice or
formation of an administrative agency and the subsequent operation
of this agency</q> <i>(italics in original).</i></p>

<h2>Dixit's approach</h2>

<p>Dixit develops an organisational approach as promoted by the likes of Buchanan,
North<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote9anc" href=
"#sdfootnote9sym" id="sdfootnote9anc">9</a></sup>, and
Williamson<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote10anc"
href="#sdfootnote10sym" id=
"sdfootnote10anc">10</a></sup>. In terms of the
political process, Dixit puts it: <q>the standard normative approach
to policy analysis views this whole process as a
social-welfare-maximising black box, exactly as the neoclassical
theory of production and supply viewed the firm as a
profit-maximising black box.....Economists studying business and
industrial organisation have long recognised the inadequacy of the
neoclassical view of the firm and developed richer paradigms and
models based on the concepts of various transaction costs</q>. Dixit
therefore suggests that a better model of the policy forming
process should be based on an analysis of the relevant transaction
costs.</p>

<p>Dixit asks what organisational forms will overcome the monopoly of information held
by bureaucrats, the opportunistic behaviour of civil servants, the
problem of divided principals, and government-owned asset
specificity? He clearly derives his approach from the writings of
Oliver Williamson and Douglass North. Dixit identifies transaction
costs involved in overcoming the asymmetric distribution of
information between parties (signaling and screening costs, costs
of monitoring and incentives, auditing costs and costs of
misrepresentation), costs involved in managing agents (monitoring,
incentives, and contractual obligations), costs of agents
responding to multiple principals (coordination of policies,
playing off one principal against another) and costs related to
asset specificity (irreversible investments and lack of
durability).</p>

<p>Following a Williamson approach, Dixit takes the view that the election process
creates a <u>contract</u> between the politicians (individuals or
parties) or administrators (regulatory agencies etc), and the
citizens (individuals or interest group organisations). The
contract is a promise of a policy (or programme) in return for
votes (or contributions). Unlike private contracts, such policy
contracts are difficult to enforce<sup><a class="f"
name="sdfootnote11anc" href="#sdfootnote11sym" id=
"sdfootnote11anc">11</a></sup>.</p>


<p>First, political contracts are rarely between two clearly identifiable
contractors; they have multiple parties (voters or lobbyists) on at
least one side of the relationship. Second, their terms are
generally much more vague (unspoken) than those of economic
contracts. They leave much room for interpretation, and many
loopholes for escape and opportunities to blame third parties or
<i>force majeure</i> for failure to deliver. Thus a promise to cut
taxes rarely specifies by how much, and can be rescinded when the
budget situation turns out to be much worse than expected. In the
electoral contract, the citizens have granted the elected
representatives certain powers to collect taxes and make decisions
on their behalf, the only safeguards in this process remains the
free vote and, if this goes, abuse of power is likely to
follow.</p>

<h2>A Westminster approach</h2>
<p>A similar approach has been put forward by ex New Zealand Treasury official,
Murray Horn. He spells out some of the details of the exchange the
two parties enter into<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote12anc" href="#sdfootnote12sym" id=
"sdfootnote12anc">12</a></sup>. His interpretation is
also driven by bounded rationality, opportunism, agency theory and
transaction costs in a parliamentary framework. He introduces some
of the specifics of the political process and the accompanying
transaction costs, including the cost of durability or lasting
impacts. This is a wider definition of transaction costs than
described by Dixit above.</p>

<p>Horn's transactions approach examines the relationship among three sets of
actors with different roles and motivations. <q>Legislators</q> are the
elected representatives who perform both legislative and executive
functions. Legislation can only be enacted by an <q>enacting
coalition</q> of individual legislators - that is, a group of
legislators that is large enough to guarantee the passage of a bill
into law. Constitutional differences between countries affect such
groupings and the solutions they might seek. <q>Administrators</q> are
appointed rather than elected. They answer to the legislature. Horn
assumes that they do not bring policy preferences to their work!
<q>Constituents</q> conveys the idea of particular groups in society
that have a [vested] interest in the policy making process.
Constituents enjoy the benefits - or suffer the costs - of
legislation, offer support or opposition to legislators, and,
ultimately, elect legislators to office. While these stereotypes
tend to simplify the complexity of the political/administrative
process in any one country, Horn maintains that they are
sufficiently general to explain decisions legislators make about
the organisation of public administration on a broad front.</p>


<p>The approach focuses on the difficulties political decision makers have in
securing continued electoral support on a longer term basis.
Legislators are regarded as self-seeking in their use of
legislation to increase their net political support and lasting
power. Their opportunities are limited by the transaction costs of
achieving agreement on their proposals. These are the time and
effort it takes to reach agreement on legislative refinements and
any time and effort that affected private interests subsequently
have to devote to participating in implementation and
administration; political uncertainty that the legislation will
last; uncertainty that the legislation will be administered as
intended; and uncertainty about the distribution of private
benefits and costs. If such relationships are regarded as the
hazards of the <q>exchange</q> between the respective actors, then they
are generically similar to Williamson's <q>far-sighted but incomplete
contracting</q>.</p>

<p>The elected/political appointees who are most likely to remain in power
are those who are most successful in overcoming these transaction
problems in the political process, such as those who are best able
to reassure their supporters that the benefits of legislation will
not be lost to administrators in implementation, or undone by
subsequent legislatures. Successful implementation will depend on
administrative agents who do not necessarily share the objectives
of the enacting coalition and its constituents; these divergences
create transaction costs to do with monitoring the performance of
such agents and devising a system of rewards and sanctions that
improve performance. There is no reference to asset specificity in
this version of the model though government administrations are
likely to depend on labour specificity in the administrative staff.
Williamson<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote13anc"
href="#sdfootnote13sym" id=
"sdfootnote13anc">13</a></sup> notes that asset
specificity is negligible in most public sector departments but
human assets in many public bureaucracies involve considerable
specificity (for example, nontransferable training and social
conditioning).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the amount of net electoral support legislators receive from
promoting a piece of legislation depends on the net flow of costs
and benefits that private interests expect it to generate over
time. Implementation bears on this calculus because private
interests are sufficiently forward looking to anticipate how
decisions on implementation will affect the flow of benefits and
costs. Political support will cease unless they are well
pleased (over time).</p>

<p>Horn's model supplements Dixit's model and brings back the broader concepts of
public choice into main focus. The uncertainties identified by
Dixit (information asymmetry, monitoring of agents and opportunism)
create costs in the political process that have to be overcome if
lasting control of the Treasury benches is to be achieved. The
model posits that the endeavours of the legislators/politicians
will continuously be directed to their own survival. This will be
achieved by paying greater attention to the wishes of their
supporters in a longer term framework. One term of office is never
sufficient.</p>


<p>Now in a certain sense, these endeavours can be regarded as an optimal
arrangement of the nation's affairs. The model posits that
effective public administration requires that the transaction costs
be minimised in determining and pursuing society's goals. There
will be pressure from constituents to find least cost solutions to
the problems of the day. There will be limits on the revenue and
challenges from alternative expenditure items including government
programmes. Debate and bargaining will tend toward least cost
solutions.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The insight from the transaction cost model of the political market is that it
mimicks how policy decisions are reached in government polities
rather better than previous constructions. Outcomes are based on
the balancing of interests and the respective power bases of the
participants. The balancing of interests extends to policy
implementation and performance. Participants have a vested interest
in who is to implement a policy and on what terms and will
influence the political decision accordingly.</p>

<p>The model recognises that power is unequally distributed and that silent
majorities tend to be forgotten. The balancing process assumes the
interested participants can anticipate future benefits and costs
that affect their welfare and that they will act in this light. The
model assumes that self-interest is dominant to the national
interest in most circumstances.</p>

<p>The model does not require any deep analysis of political motives but rather sets
out a useful framework that explains the process in which economic
policy is conceived and executed. It clearly posits that decision
making has to be a political process subject to electoral demands
and interest group pressure on the one hand, and national interest
concerns contained in rational advice from civil servants (who may
or may not be disinterested) on the other.</p>

<p>It can be
utilised to examine the structure of government bureaucratic
organisations. Oliver Williamson offers a detailed analysis of the
US Department of State<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote14anc" href="#sdfootnote14sym" id=
"sdfootnote14anc">14</a></sup>. He asks: could the
organisation of foreign affairs by the Department of State be
replaced by a private bureau? Not surprisingly, perhaps, he comes
to the conclusion that it cannot and that there are specific tasks
for which a government bureau is more suited. These tasks include
situations where hazards of probity (lack of honesty) are to be
avoided and organisational matters such as dependence on labour
asset specificity (social conditioning and reliance).</p>


<p>The model indicates that blackboard exercises involving producer and consumer
surpluses are of limited use in policy making. The presence of
transaction costs will suggest different solutions to a policy
problem depending where they fall. The case for government
intervention in the market failure case is not clearcut if the
costs of intervention outweigh the possible benefits. There may be
little or no relationship between the costs and benefits estimated
by the outside observer and the evaluations that individuals place
on alternatives in actual choice situations<sup><a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote15anc" href="#sdfootnote15sym" id=
"sdfootnote15anc">15</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Another application is to ask whether the <i>policy advice function</i> in
a government bureau could be contracted out? The Canadian
department of agriculture, Agriculture Canada, explored this option
and sponsored a study of a similar proposal in New
Zealand<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote16anc" href=
"#sdfootnote16sym" id="sdfootnote16anc">16</a></sup>.
While the study recognised that alternative sources of advice
should be sought, for informational reasons, it came to the
conclusion that confidentiality and probity concerns made the
function more suitable for a public bureau.</p>

<p>More widely, the international flavour of the analysis overcomes the dominance
of US writing on the subject dependent as it is on interpretations
of the US constitution<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote17anc" href="#sdfootnote17sym" id=
"sdfootnote17anc">17</a></sup>. Murray Horn, in
particular, while drinking at the fountain at Harvard, has
incorporated the Westminster tradition into his version of the
model and broadened its application to include state-owned
profit-making organisations as well as government-financed
bureaus.</p>


<p>While there is still an emphasis on democratic governmental decision making,
particularly with regard to maintaining electoral support, the
focus on institutional economics broadens the application to
non-democratic regimes and offers a fruitful avenue of further
research<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote18anc" href=
"#sdfootnote18sym" id="sdfootnote18anc">18</a></sup>. It
also provides an entry point to the analysis of malfeasance and
corruption in government administrations.<sup><a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote19anc" href="#sdfootnote19sym" id=
"sdfootnote19anc">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Another application is in the distribution and administration of foreign
aid. Many IMF and World Bank programmes are focused on particular
national policy programmes or projects which depend on local
initiatives and execution<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote20anc" href="#sdfootnote20sym" id=
"sdfootnote20anc">20</a></sup>. The strengths and
weaknesses of national administrations very soon come to the fore
when visiting economists seek answers to poor response rates to
massive aid packages. Institutional economics offers useful
guidance to those seeking reform in E. Europe<sup><a class=
"f" name="sdfootnote21anc" href="#sdfootnote21sym" id=
"sdfootnote21anc">21</a></sup>.</p>

<p>A powerful analysis of EU milk policy in this tradition has been published by
FAO<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote22anc" href=
"#sdfootnote22sym" id="sdfootnote22anc">22</a></sup>. In
this study, Roland Williams, an ex-official of the Milk Marketing
Board, shows how the details of the policy emanated from the terms
of the Treaties establishing the European Community. The Treaties
provide the <i>constitution</i> of the Union for making individual
acts of <i>common</i> policy, but the individual constitutions of
the member states (in all their diversity) provide for the
implementation of policy where governments and agencies are
dependent on the traditions of past policies and national
legislation<sup><a class="f" name="sdfootnote23anc"
href="#sdfootnote23sym" id=
"sdfootnote23anc">23</a></sup>. Williams suggests that
little can be changed in the way of <q>policy</q> without first changing
the constitutional arrangements which allowed them to develop as
they have in the first place<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote24anc" href="#sdfootnote24sym" id=
"sdfootnote24anc">24</a></sup>. He explicitly rejects <q>a
marginalist approach in which judgement is passed on the system in
relation to what the writer <i>believes</i> would be the oucome of
a free-market situation</q>.(<i>italics in original).</i></p>


<p>I have argued elsewhere for a more realistic policy-making framework as a guide
to better policy making<sup><a class="f" name=
"sdfootnote25anc" href="#sdfootnote25sym" id=
"sdfootnote25anc">25</a></sup>. National and
international advisors in ministries would benefit from a better
understanding of the institutional background. University training
could benefit from the teaching of more institutional economics and
its practical applications. More university people could with
advantage work in the civil service. General economists could
re-assess their welfare models and voluminous writings in the
professional literature and pay greater regard to the conditions
under which their policy recommendations will have to operate. The
world of Pigou would then find its proper place.</p>
