<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Research yields results in terms of the sum of knowledge available to all possible 
users. These may be other scientists or may be commercial entities which seek to 
apply such knowledge for economic gain. It is convenient to visualise such 
knowledge as a <q>pool</q> resource which has public good characteristics. It can be 
drawn down without affecting the supply of the good as it is commonly in the 
public domain, and it can only be privatised when private entities control the 
provision of research or fund research and apply patents to any results 
forthcoming. This paper is about the public pool of Research and Development knowledge. The benefits 
to other scientists is an interesting question but is not followed up here.</p>

<p>The problem addressed in this paper is how to model the draw-down of research 
knowledge into the real economy. It would be ideal if chunks of knowledge could 
be identified and cast into a cost-benefit model. In fact, the pool of knowledge is 
rather undifferentiated until it finds some practical use. The cost of obtaining 
particular knowledge is lost in the overall process of research organisation. Given 
this vagueness in research cost it is difficult to trace a direct line of cause and 
effect from the costs to the benefits. This paper therefore examines:</p>
<p>(a) whether stocks of research knowledge designated for particular sectors have 
some relationship to changes in sectoral productivity in national income terms. At 
this level of aggregation, particular pieces of research knowledge cannot be 
identified and broad-brush association between cause and effect must be sought. 
Designated research knowledge itself is not particularly precise as such a concept 
is somewhat in conflict with the idea that research knowledge is a public good 
without specific applications identified, and:</p>
<p>(b) whether incremental additions to the stock of Research and Development as represented by past 
Research and Development expenditure patterns have an effect on sectoral productivity. The effect of  
previous expenditure on changes in productivity can be modelled as a system of 
distributed lags. In effect, such a model can measure the uptake of research 
knowledge as it is generated without involving the stock of knowledge concept. 
While this hypothesis sounds the less plausible in modelling a public resource, it 
does provide more logical explanations of the research/productivity relationship.</p>

<h2>The Data</h2>
  
<p>Expenditure data on Research and Development can be obtained from the surveys carried out by MoRST in 
recent years and from Government records (MoRST var). This is available at a 
national level and broken down into the main economic sectors (See Appendix).  
National accounting data provides time series of economic investment, labour force 
and net output on a sectoral basis (25 sectors in NZSNA) and hence provides estimates 
of average total factor productivity (TFP) for each sector. Using a production function 
approach, the adoption process can be incorporated in the analysis of productivity 
change (Industry Commission 1995). This can take a number of forms. In this paper, 
knowledge is first treated as a stock variable which grows and shrinks as information 
is added to it or lost from it (Coe and Helpman 1993). Cost of knowledge is 
represented by firm investment in Research and Development, and depreciation is represented by knowledge 
going out of date or being superseded (Griliches 1979, 1980). Thus the pool of 
knowledge is valued at cost and not by what it potentially could generate in increased 
returns. Secondly, the research process could be viewed as a continuous cost of 
producing certain science-based goods (either through taxes paid or in-house 
investment) that eventually pays off through better performance. Where such costs can 
be identified, current levels of performance can be seen as a function of some 
weighted combination of all previous annual expenditures on Research and Development (Johnson and 
Pazderka 1993). These flows can be treated econometrically to estimate an average 
rate of return or cost-benefit ratio.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that annual data for Research and Development expenditure by firms and 
government is the primary source of data. Previous results (Johnson 1999) were 
based on the construction of <q>stock</q> variables using pre-determined depreciation 
rates (5%). To more systematically understand which approach to take, stocks 
were estimated for 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% depreciation rates. 
Secondly, lagged values of previous expenditure on Research and Development using polynomial 
distributed lags (PDLs) were investigated for the same data using the Almon 
formula (Almon 1965).</p> 

<p>The general production function is Cobb-Douglas as follows:</p>

<p class='it'>(1)&nbsp;		Y = K<sup>a</sup> L<sup>b</sup> R<sup>g</sup>  Z<sup>s</sup>,</p>   

<p>where</p>		
<p class='ind'><i>R</i> is the stock of knowledge capital; and</p>
<p class='ind'><i>Z</i> is other factors affecting measured productivity beside Labour and Capital.</p>

<p>In the production function approach, a log linear version of equation (1) is estimated 
directly:</p>

<p class='it'>(2)&nbsp;	     ln Y =  a ln K + b ln L + g ln R + s ln Z</p> 

<p>In the two-step productivity approach, equation (2) would be rewritten as :</p>

<p class='it'>(3)&nbsp;	      ln Y - a ln K - b ln L  =  TFP = g ln R + s ln Z</p>

<p>In either case, estimates of the parameter g can be converted from an elasticity to an 
overall rate of return dY/dR as given by:</p>

<p class='it'>(4)&nbsp;		dY/dR = g (Y/R).</p>

<p>For the depreciation model we are using the specification:</p>

<p class='it'>(5)&nbsp;	TFP<sub>t</sub> = f( PV<sub>t-1</sub> , PU<sub>t-1</sub> , AUR<sub>t-1</sub> , EDU<sub>t-1</sub> )</p> 

		<p class='it blocktext small'>(TFP = total factor productivity, PV = private stock of R&amp;D, PU = public 
		stock of R&amp;D, AUR = Australian stock of R&amp;D, EDU = national expenditure 
		on university education)</p>

<p>The distributed lag model is based on the following specification:</p>

<p class='it'>(6)&nbsp;	TFP<sub>t</sub> = f(  PVE <sub>t-1</sub> , PVE <sub>t-2</sub> , ........PVE <sub>t-15</sub>)</p>

<p class='ind small it'>(PVE/PUE = annual private/public expenditure on Research and Development)</p>
 
<h2>Depreciation rates</h2>

<p>Table 1 shows estimated elasticities (g) and resulting rates of return for the 
agricultural (AG) and market (MK) sectors at different depreciation rates for 
stocks of Research and Development. This specification included Australian R &amp; D and educational 
expenditure as independent variables (as in (3) and (5) above) and has the best 
DW.</p>

<p>As was shown previously, total factor productivity was positively related to 
private Research and Development stocks and negatively related to public R &amp; D stocks in the market 
economy (MK) and agriculture (AG) sectors. But as Table 1 shows, manipulation 
of the depreciation rate is compensatory (at least for the two sectors shown). The 
elasticity decreases as the depreciation rate rises until annual data takes over 
completely (remember that 50% depreciation implies that most of the change in 
TFP is <q>explained by</q> the previous years' investment in Research and Development and only half the 
stock of a year earlier and so on).</p>   

<p>The rate of return on the investment in Research and Development (as defined) is remarkably constant 
across different depreciation rates. Immediate past investment dominates all the 
results. The general pattern remains one of positive returns for private Research and Development and 
negative returns for public Research and Development in the perpetual inventory specification implied. 
The rates of return on private Research and Development suggest large social returns to the previous 
investment.</p>

<h2>Polynomial distributed lags</h2>

<p>Polynomial distributed lags (PDLs) provide smoothed coefficients determined by 
fitting a polynomial function to past annual values of a predetermined number of 
years of the independent variable. In this case the number of past years was set at 
16. The current value of the independent variable is dropped as the specification 
requires. Other possible influential variables are not included so all possible gains 
are attributed to successive values of the one independent variable as in (6). 
Private and public Research and Development equations are estimated separately for the market (MK) 
and agriculture (AG) sectors (Table 2).</p>

<p>As these regressions are multifactorial, each coefficient is an estimate of the 
elasticity with regard to that time lag. The sum of the coefficients gives the 
average elasticity with respect to Research and Development. In all cases, the sum is positive and looks 
as though it will stay positive though diminishing quickly as extra years are 
included. Contrary to previous results, therefore, the  return to public Research and Development 
expenditure is now positive if the longer term is taken into account. There is also a 
distinct short term benefit apparent in three cases. <i>Thus the pattern of build-up and 
use of a stock of knowledge may not follow any particular perpetual inventory 
rules</i>. These results show that in each case the return function is not monotonic, 
and hence two turning points appear. In this case, the mean lag estimation cannot 
be relied upon.</p> 

<p>Negative returns can be interpreted as delays in the production process following 
new expenditure on Research and Development. On average, the delays appear to be of the order of 4-6 
years before production responds, and the peak response is reached after 11-13 
years. This compares with Scobie and Eveleen's (1986) estimate of 11 years for 
the agriculture sector for the period 1920-1980.</p>              

<p>Table 3 shows the sum of the elasticity coefficients for annual expenditures on 
Research and Development in eight sectors and the total market economy examined in this project (the 
services sector has no separate identifiable Research and Development):</p>

<p>In most cases a positive long-term return is obtained. The exceptions are public 
Research and Development in the forestry, manufacturing and transport sectors. The magnitude of the 
rate of return estimate has to be interpreted as a social dividend to previous 
research undertaken by private and public agencies. It is not an internal rate of 
return which would have to take account of the lags in the response times. Scobie 
and Eveleens quote an internal rate of return for agriculture of 30 per cent. These 
results suggest higher internal rates of return than this in some sectors. The sectors 
with negative returns are characterised by long waits for positive results to be 
apparent.</p>

<p>These results also confirm that the turning points are fairly uniform across sectors at 4-
6 years in the medium term and 12-13 years in the longer term. Since these results are 
so uniform it is likely that there is a common driving force behind the equations - this 
appears to be the link of private Research and Development expenditure to GDP. On the other hand, the 
elasticities are also determined by changes in sectoral GDP which in some sectors is 
very different from the aggregate.</p>

<p>The overall result shows that total national expenditure on Research and Development in the private sector 
returns to the nation $2 for every $ spent. Owing to the delays in reaching a positive 
result, this is equivalent to an internal return of 2.1%! This is much lower than the 
return suggested by the stock method. For the public sector, the average return is only 
$1 for every $ spent. Public expenditure on science is only just recovered in gdp terms. 
This is equivalent to a 0.1% internal rate of return, but is not negative as the stock 
results indicated. These overall results tend to confirm earlier suspicions that the 
respective rates of return to private and public expenditure were out of balance in TFP 
terms in the past, and that total returns on Research and Development investment are relatively 
disappointing.</p>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>We started with the hypothesis that research knowledge is a pool resource with public 
good properties. The process of utilisation of this resource was modelled along 
conventional lines by treating the accumulation of knowledge as a capital stock valued 
at cost and subject to some rate of obsolescence. We tested different rates of 
obsolescence (depreciation) of the stock thus created and found little differentiation in 
the results both for sign of the response and the rate of return on capital. Returns to 
private Research and Development were all positive and returns to public R &amp; D were all negative. 
Alternatively, the additions to the stock of research knowledge were modelled in a 
distributed lag framework where delays in uptake could be identified. A definite 
pattern emerged of 4-5 year delays in private Research and Development and 12-13 years in public R &amp; D. 
Both responses were positive in the longer run.</p>

<p>These results demonstrate that modelling a pool resource like scientific knowledge is 
fraught with difficulties and that the literature and methodologies on the subject have 
not yet reached a fully satisfactory level. It may be too difficult in the aggregate data 
available at the sector level but some progress might be made at the individual 
application level where the cost of the research and resulting benefits can be readily 
identified. Even this approach does not account for spillovers from the pool from one 
sector to another, nor the benefits of knowledge gained to other scientists. There are 
also international spillovers to be considered as the <q>pool</q> has always been a global 
one and the benefits available to all those who wish to find them.</p>

<p>There are also questions about the quality of data available. The series on public 
expenditure on Research and Development is faithfully recorded back to the 1960s by NRAC and the 
government departments. It may be sub-divided quite accurately for the major 
economic sectors supported by Research and Development effort at the time. There is no equivalent R &amp; D 
data for the private sector except for the MoRST series since 1989. The data used in 
this analysis relies heavily on an extrapolation based on shares of national income. 
This imparts a similarity to the sector data on private Research and Development that runs throughout this 
analysis. Even so, sectoral TFP statistics exhibit quite different behaviours in response 
to a variable based on this definition of their Research and Development efforts.</p>

<p>Members of the audience might like to suggest further hypotheses and specifications 
for future research!</p>
