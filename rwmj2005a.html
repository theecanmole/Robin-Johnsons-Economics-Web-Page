<h1>Thomas Johnson: A Pioneer and Seer</h1>
<p class="by">by Robin Johnson</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>My grandfather emigrated on an assisted passage to Dunedin in 1861 on the vessel <em>Melbourne</em> out of Leith in Scotland. He was born in Manchester in 1834 and had been living in the Castleford area of Yorkshire. He died in Wellington in 1905 after a busy life as a printer, publisher and proof reader in the Government Printing Office. I have reconstructed his life and activities from a few personal documents that survive, auxilary information from public sources, and from a memoire written by my father, John Johnson, in the 1960s. The first point of interest is the lack of solid records about my grandfather's life and times and the need to reconstruct his life from what records survive. A second point of interest is that grandfather toyed with spiritualism for part of his life. He and his brother Samuel Johnson have left records of messages they received through a seer or medium which could be interpreted as originating from their family back in England. The OED defines a seer as a person who sees visions or is a person of prenatural insight. My research indicates that spiritualism was on the rise in northern England in the late 1850s and early 1860s and the two brothers must have embraced such practices before they emigrated in 1861 and 1862 respectively. In this article I will indicate how these alternative sources of information have been used at appropriate places. A third point of interest, no doubt common to other families, is the way the next generation in a family selectively discards parts of the family records when estates are being cleared up leaving very little for the present generation to work on.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>We can establish from the <em>International Genealogical Index</em> that a Thomas Johnson, saddler, married a Hannah Cope, at St Mary's, Manchester on 2nd July 1826. They had two sons, Samuel born 16 March 1827, and Thomas born 9<sup>th</sup> February 1834 (<em>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</em>, Volume II). Samuel apparently learnt the printer's trade and Thomas became his apprentice in 1850. One relative left a record that the printing business was at 87 Piccadilly, Manchester (Mabel Nicol, nee Johnson, Samuel's granddaughter) and that Thomas was traveller to the firm at that time. Around 1858 Samuel Johnson bought the <em>Castleford Mail</em> in northeast Yorkshire and remained there until he emigrated in 1862. He joined the Albertlanders expedition and settled temporarily at Port Albert on the Kaipara Harbour before moving to Auckland and later to Blenheim (see later).</p>

<p>Thomas the younger was released from his apprenticeship in 1857 but continued to work for his brother in Castleford. We have documents that indicate he attended the Quaker Meeting of the Society of Friends in Doncaster and Castleford and a reference addressed to the immigration authorities from Pontefract Meeting. We have no record on why he chose to emigrate to New Zealand although as subsequent events showed he did have differences of opinion with his elder brother, and was of an independent and sometimes rebellious nature.</p>

<p>In the 1850s an enthusiam for spiritualism developed in the UK after being introduced from the US and particularly found a ready audience in the north of England.among working class and lower middle class workers. While we have no direct evidence we have to surmise that Samuel and Thomas were willing to embrace the ideas of spiritualism and dip into its practices on occasion. The Dictionary of NZ Biography identifies Samuel as a long-time Freemason and a few surviving relics of Thomas indicate that he attended both Quaker Meetings and the Methodist Church in England and later took part in the United Christian Mission and the British Israel Association in Wellington in the 1890s. We have also found in Thomas' papers an undated leaflet about spiritualism; <em>'Spiritualism and the Word of God; Spiritualism a Reality and not a Sham'</em>,  published by the Bible Book and Tract Depot, Manners Street, Wellington, and printed by Edwards and Co (Late Edwards and Green) Printers. Emigrants from the north of England in the C19 were commonly linked by their adherence to non-conformism and a wish to get away from the organised church.</p>

<p>Thomas Johnson also had a life long interest in astrology. He came to believe that there was a connection between planetary motions and the weather. He noticed old records that earthquakes follow on the heels of eclipses and when planets are in aspect of great comets their conjunction causes wind and storms. We have a record of a letter he wrote to the Government Meteorologist of Queensland in 1899 drawing attention to this work and that of a Professor Totten in the USA. Alas, the said gentleman replied to the effect that he would go in to the matter when he had more time but not just at present!</p>

<p>The exact evidence for their involvement in such practices comes from a series of hand-written notes or possibly letters which someone [very likely Thomas] wrote out in a notebook between 1853 and 1867. The notes are records of conversations with an unknown seer or seers who offered advice to the two brothers on a regular basis. Some of the notes read as though they are letters from their parents [especially when they are still in the UK] but after they come to NZ the timing indicates that the messages are coming through a medium of some sort. When this diary is the source of information given it will be acknowledged as such in what follows.</p>

<p>The historian, Shaun Broadley, has noted that there was a steady stream of emigrants to Dunedin with a first hand knowledge of spiritualist matters from the 1860s onwards. (Broadley 1999). He notes that there was an outbreak of activity in Dunedin 1868-69 and in Victoria in the late 1860s. With the discovery of gold in Gabriel's Gully in 1861 there was an inrush of shiploads of miners, entrepeneurs and adventurers into Otago mainly from Victoria. In Dunedin town, there was considerable friction between 'old settlers' and 'immoral rogues from Victoria'. Broadley relates the outbreak in activity to the popular spread of spiritualism in Britain from the 1850s onwards. There was an intellectual centre of spiritualism based in London and a more working class interest in the northern industrial towns. The latter was characterised by 'a strong anti-Christian sentiment, mainly lower middle class and upper working class' by people who had typically reacted to the co-operative teachings of Robert Owen who had himself embraced spiritualism at some stage. Oppenheim (1985) talks of the industrious working class in in her book on spiritualism and psychical research in England, 1850-1914. <cite><q>As with their counterparts in the whitecollar professions, members of the working classes were not slow to turn to spiritualism after 1850</q></cite>. She recounts the popularity of mediums in the north and the numbers of people who attended spititualist meetings. <cite><q>By the mid 1860s spiritualism was gaining a considerable foothold amongst artisans and the more educated working men, and these pretty soon came to constitute the bulk of its supporters</q></cite>. Oppenheim even mentions a trance medium by the name of Johnson who conducted spiritualist services on Sunday in the Temperance Hall in Grosvenor Street, Manchester, who was a compositor by profession. This appears to be in the 1870s.</p>

<p>The timing of these events in England is just right for the period when the Johnson brothers were working in Manchester and Castleford and hence it is likely they could be influenced by them. Thus I am inclined to think that my grandfather and his brother were familiar with the role of spiritualist mediums in England and were prepared to consult one when occasion demanded. The brothers exchanged messages between them and continued the practice up to 1867 when the Blenheim partnership broke up. It was the faithful recording of these messages that enables us to interpret them down to this day.</p>
<p>On the question of what a medium could add to the sum total of knowledge about a given situation, a plausible interpretation is that the brothers were likely to supply most of the requisite information in some form or another, from which the medium could deduce what the answers required would likely be. There is no trace in the records handed down as to who the medium(s) were.</p>

<h2>Life in England in the 1850s</h2>
<p>Thomas Johnson the younger was apprenticed to his brother Samuel from 1850 to 1857. This would have been the printers business located at 87 Piccadilly, Manchester, before the brothers moved to Castleford in 1858. For some time, Thomas had been a traveller for the firm. From about 1853, possible messages from mediums indicate that Thomas had doubts about his employment. The seer advises him <cite><q>Be as gentlemanly as you can...be very quick in speaking...your slow dull tone condemns you...you must say to yourself...This occupation is an honourabe one and though despised by some yet it hath been appointed by my heavenly father. I will commence by performing my part faithfully</q></cite>.</p>

<p>After the move to Castleford, Thomas is discussing marriage with the medium (or is it his father?) The reply comes <cite><q>Nothing earthly can give you real happiness but a home where each breathes for each other and each is overawed by the presence of God. If you wish to partake more largely of this feeling you should both worship in one temple. He cannot have the same pleasure in viewing a wife in one place and a husband in another, and perhaps a child in another</q></cite>. Another note dated April 3 1860 says <cite><q>By marrying this woman , I see much sorrow. Try to do right, thou art not forgotten</q></cite>.</p>
<p>By August of that year the subject matter changes. <cite><q>It is very likely that your application [presumably for emigration] may be favourably received. If so, enquire again, and I will tell you how to proceed. In the meantine keep your own secret. It is not a favourable time for enquiry. As to your separation [from Samuel?] you will again be united under more favourable circumstances</q></cite>. Another message says <cite><q>Have no fears. It will be best for thee to go away. Trials there will be, but it will turn out well in the end. Be sure to get plenty of good, warm clothing. As to going away to see thy friends in Manchester or elsewhere, it will answer no good; it will only be a waste of time and money</q></cite>.</p>

<p>Also from this period we have a letter to an unknown person [copy obviously having been kept by Thomas] giving Thomas? impressions of the Society of Friends in the Castleford area. He mentions meeting a John Cass, a Quaker, who has a young daughter. He wanted to know more of their religious beliefs and thus started attending Quaker Meeting in Pontefract and Castleford. He admits that he had been attending the Methodist Free Church and the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Castleford but it was in Doncaster that he went to the Quaker meeting place and was invited to participate. He found this very pleasing and continued to attend in Castleford when work took him back there. We have a reference from the Pontefract Society of Friends dated 21 October 1860 saying he was most likely to succeed as an emigrant! He departed from Leith in Scotland on 18 November 1860 on the <em>Melbourne</em>. In the ship?s manifest he is recorded as coming from Nuneaton, Yorkshire (information from Ralph Johnson and the <em>Otago Witness 23/3/63</em>).</p>

<p>I see this period as Thomas sometimes rebelling against his brother while continuing to work for him. He is a bit of a free spirit and attends various non-conformist church groups. He is thinking about marriage and he is consulting a medium if not his father.</p>

<h2>New Zealand</h2>
<p>The <em>Melbourne</em> reached Port Chalmers on 16<sup>th</sup> January 1861. In the period up to 1866 we know that Thomas set up a printers business in Dunedin, married an Irish emigrant, and dealt with intermittent reports that Samuel was also emigrating. We deal with Samuel?s movement in the next section.</p>

<p>In a message received in Dunedin on 24th Nov 1862, the seer says: <cite><q>A married life would add greatly to thy happiness....It is very likely by becoming a librarian thou might meet with some one...There is one word I would like to say to thee, my child,. try to live in peace with thy brother...</q></cite></p>
<p>Is this the mother talking to Thomas or a third person? Samuel arrived in September 1862</p>
<p>There is a further message on Dec 23rd. <cite><q>Query: The diggings - as miner, or business? A: Never think of digging for gold. On the Dunstan you would do well. Wait patiently. I cannot answer the other questions today. Cultivate a spirit of patient thankfulness - greater evils may befall you</q></cite> [Is this the third person?]</p>

<p>On 29th December, Query: <cite><q>Selection of materials-Upper Township-Monday. No replies to advt.- Michael -Letter home.</q></cite> Answer: <cite><q>I must pass thy enquiriies on now. Meet me on Wednesday; I will reply. Go on with thy preparations; you will be sure to do well.....One word about the letter. The girl would make thee a good wife, and thy home happy. She is worth struggling and waiting for...I will give thee some directions on Wednesday for going away</q></cite></p>
<p>On the 31st December: <cite><q>The undertaking will be a successful one. When I spoke of not taking your type, I saw there would not be a use for all your plant. As to time for going: I should say lose no time....As I said before the girl will make thee a good and happy wife. Should her mother consider it not prudent to send her child, you have the means of accumulating wealth in a short time, to enable thee to go to her home and fetch her. She would choose thee before any other</q></cite>. This is a reference to an Annie Graham back in Britain. In March 1863 Samuel leaves Dunedin and goes to Albertland</p>
<p>Dunedin May 13, 1863: <cite><q>Tarry <span class="u1">here</span>...It would not be well to leave this place..</q></cite></p>
<p>Dunedin May 26, 1863: <cite><q>You may buy the press safely...</q></cite></p>
<p>Dunedin June 2, 1863: <cite><q>So far as I can see you can give the man a trial...</q></cite></p>
<p>Dunedin June 8, 1863: <cite><q>Annie is not coming; I mean at present. She would be glad to marry you if you would go to England...Mrs Graham would make thee a good wife....As to these estimates you brought before me, I would say have nothing to do with them. Thou hast neither material, money, nor mind, to compass them...I am well pleased that you have considered the distress of others. When you render assistance in need you are indeed lending to the Lord..You are never more like your heavenly Master than when you hear the cry of the widow, the orphan, or the distressed...As to your removing or changing your residence. You must exercise your own judgement. As I told you before, the water is bad. In these things you must do according to your means. This will apply to the jouney to Auckland to Port Albert. When you feel that you have all else in readiness you can enquire again...</q></cite></p>
<p>Dunedin, 15 June, 1863: <cite><q>There must be no going away......Get rid of the house thou hast taken.....Thou must not live with this woman until she is your wife [Mary Flinn]. She would make thee a good wife I would not have you marry her in any circumstances for at least six months...You are doing right to give her a home..Why was my counsel not sought before taking this house?...I cannot advise you how to act. You have taken a false step. Thyrza must not go away at present. You have not the means; neither would it be wise to do so...</q></cite> (Therese, daughter of Samuel)</p>
<p>Dunedin, June 17, 1863: <cite><q>As I said before, Annie is not coming. Her mother might be induced to let her come if you persevered in writing. Though Annie would make thee a good wife; yea all that thou could'st desire, she is not the only one. I told thee Mrs Graham would make thee a good wife, and with her thou might taste all the enjoyment of a wedded life...Oh Tom, be careful to whom thou marry..A good woman is precious...I have not yet answered thy heart's enquiry: 'Whom then shall I marry?'. I cannot do this, my child, or I would....Samuel will do well where he is if he will only persevere..</q></cite></p>
<h2>The dialogue continues</h2>
<p>Dunedin June 22, 1863: <cite><q>With respect to the house, have nothing to do with it. I would not advise you to leaving this house at present, as you could make better arrangements by taking time to think...</q></cite></p>
<p><cite><q>The person and object you are most anxious about - Mary Flynn and - marrying are the things I wish most to speak with you about. You inquire: 'Will she do?' Yes. She will make thee happy...As to the best time and place, I cannot name. You can arrange these things among yourselves</q></cite>.</p>
<p>June 29, 1863: <cite><q>The time for marrying is not a bad one, but it might have been better. Mary will, as I have said, make thee a good wife...And now to thy family. Let nothing break the bonds of love that unite you. Let no money consideration come between thee and thy Brother. Remember, thy Father and thy Mother are watching over you...</q></cite> This is the day Thomas and Mary got married.</p>
<p>July 30, 1863: <cite><q>...I would rather advise thee to remain where thou art at present. One thing must be done: you must divide your home, for sorrow and trouble is gathering around you. I am thy mother, nay all your mothers [sic] I will not find fault...Should Michael(?) feel disposed to join thee it would be a great help. When thy family have gone, thou will surely need support. Samuel had better remain away if he can - his family joining him at the time you have talked about before - the <span class="u1">Lord Ashley</span> or any vessel answering to that time...attend to what I have said. You can enquire again before going away; I have much more to say to you....Should Samuel return there are many ways in which you might do well. A house such as you have talked about would succeed - yea well</q></cite>. (Michael Flinn, Mary's brother, emigrated from Ireland on 28/1/71 on the <em>William Davie</em>, Otago Provincial Gazette 1869-75, Hocken Library)</p>
<p>September 1 1863: With regard to some business matter <cite><q>You have brought these things on yourselves. Have you paid strict attention to your business? Has there been no lack of attention?...I could not admire a partner except for a trusty friend...</q></cite></p>
<p>October 7 1863 In response to another query: <cite><q>With respect to the luggage : Take what you can as far as Auckland. Leave it there until such time as you can send for them...I would have thee remain in thy present place for a time, say three months at least..I would not have thee enter into any business speculation for some time to come...</q></cite></p>
<p>(This is the last message in this sequence)</p>
<h2>Marriage</h2>
<p>We know from the marriage register at Knox Presbyterian Church that on 29 June 1863 Thomas Johnson, printer, was married to Mary Flinn, spinster, at the residence of Mary Flinn at Andrew St Dunedin (Ralph Johnson). The certificate is not signed by Mary but has a space for 'her mark'. We also know that a Mary Flinn, domestic servant, emigrated from Ireland on the <em>Jura</em> and arrived at Port Chalmers on 6<sup>th</sup> October 1862.</p>
<p>From the above diaries I read it that Thomas took Mary in to his house (address not clear) and provided her and possibly others with shelter. They later get married. She appears to be illiterate. This appears to be after Samuel goes north to join the Albertlanders at Port Albert in March 1863 having come down from Auckland the previous September. There is debate about Thomas going to Port Albert though nothing comes of it.</p>
<h2>Samuel Johnson Arrives</h2>
<p>Soon after Thomas decided to emigrate, his brother Samuel also decides to emigrate to New Zealand and gets involved in the Albertlanders expedition. The <em>Matilda Wattenbach</em> sailed from the East India Docks on 29<sup>th</sup> May 1862, arriving in Auckland on 8<sup>th</sup> September 1862. The Albertlanders were a group of non-conformist idealists who wanted to to set up a model community at a site at Port Albert on the Kaipara Harbour (<em>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</em>, Vol II). Samuel came down to Dunedin straight away, but went back up to Port Albert in March 1863, after considering going to the gold diggings. He stayed at the new colony until July 1864 when he put his house up for sale and moved to Auckland. (Borrows J. L., 1969; Brett H,, 1927).</p>
<p>There is a copy of a message taken down at Castleford dated June 17 1861 possibly from Samuel to his parents: <cite><q>Tom sends us a note, holding out a better prospect in N.Z. Will it be well to think of and prepare for migrating thither?</q></cite>.An undated reply says: <cite><q>I should very much like to see you re-united. I gave you some advice before, that Tom should return, because I saw the need of your supporting one another. I have always said you would get money here; but not with that swiftness or ease you would get in the land whither he has gone</q></cite>.</p>
<p>The authorship of these letters is a puzzle. Thomas writes they are "communicated by my Father" (p.8); elsewhere he writes himself down as a 'seer' (p.1); then in a letter said to be addressed to Samuel dated 7th November 1860 the diarist notes that the provenance is the 'same' and adds 'To Saml Johnson' and the message continues <cite><q>I would rather be silent as it [going away to N.Z.] will bring with it many sorrows....have cautioned you before to forbearance, and him to submission. Now the storm is gathering. You will all need comfort and consolation. My youngest child will know many sorrows in a strange land; I too see dangers of a watery grave or a fatal disease. You had better keep this from his Father...</q></cite>. Is this the mother, Hannah Cope speaking or a medium? In a letter from Castleford April 30 1861 Samuel asks "Have you anything to say respecting Tom; Have you word for him, Mother?". In another letter of July 22 1861 to Samuel it says: <cite><q>Hannah is consumptive which she inherits from her mother; so also is your little one</q></cite>. So the diarist has not carefully delineated which letters are from which parent or from a medium for us to be sure except through content.</p>
<p>A copy of a letter of July 22 1861, addressed to Samuel, appears to have been received in Dunedin on 1st October 1861. Thomas notes [later?] that his father died September 24th 1861. Thus the next message dated October 9th 1861 and received Jan 4 1862, could be from Hannah to Samuel or Hannah to Thomas. <cite><q>You may make what offer you can, but I would not advise you to go this year, or before the time you have named</q></cite>. Sounds like Samuel's decision to emigrate to me. The letter also says <cite><q>Your family affliction will be quite sufficient for you for some time to come...</q></cite> [reference to Therese born 1852 or Hannah born 1861]</p>
<p>Next on December 20 of that year from Castleford the diarist asks whether it would not be better to think of joining the Nonconformists movement, and turn farmer? [Is this the Albertlanders?]. Could this be Thomas? answer or his mother or who? <cite><q>You would do better in any part of New Zealand as printers than you would do here, the chances are as 6 to 1.....Should you feel inclined for farming I could promise a life of true, quiet happiness with abundance on every hand; you would feel your family provided for in the course of two or three years....I do not know everything but Tom is at fault. He has not kept his own counsel</q></cite>. So its not Tom! Next question was: <cite><q>Is there anything I can say to Tom by next letter</q></cite> She replies I think <cite><q>Be united: you will find comfort with each other you cannot find elsewhere. My two sons: let love bind you together. Tell him not to forget God's great mercy toward him</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Samuel's correspondence next comes from New Zealand. As at Port Albert, Auckland, Feb 1/64: <cite><q>This house is your own; make it as comfortable as you can. The land adjoining may be made very productive...I would not recommend that you give up the paper [<span class="u1">Albertland Gazette</span>]. It is a powerful organ to express wrong and encourage right...I would advise keeping a cow...Tom may do so (begin business again). ..There is an opening for him in the jobbing trade.There is a good opening in Auckland. But you may make yourselves very happy here...</q></cite></p>
<p>Port Albert, Auckland, May 16, 1864: <cite><q>Be not cast down. There is a mystery thrown over this [the missing letter - see <span class="u1">The Albertlanders</span>] I cannot reveal.You are called on to suffer for a reason...Act calmly with dignity.. Tom is wayward, ungovernable, and yet unable to govern. He will have many trials yet, and hard battles to fight. Write and tell him he is at fault. He ought to have accommodated himself to his partners. Tell him this</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Port Albert, Auckland, June 2, 1864: <cite><q>Tell Tom: In following his own advice he has met with his own reward. I have always advised you to draw together as you could. ..My advice to him is not to go into business in Dunedin; he left when he should have done this. He may remain there in [a] situation until he has the means to go elsewhere. I could advise Picton, and say many things in its favour, but I could say much more in favor of coming to Auckland....I would advise Tom, if nothing else offers-I mean if he does see his way to come nearer-to sell all, or such as he can. He will do no good by himself,unless he be near thee, either for advice or for supervision; he hath not the business tact that is required..He is being whipped with the rod of correction. You are suffering trials too, which might have been avoided if you had remained together...My greatest desire is that you send for him to Auckland; he being so near; you could then sympathise and advise with one another, and lay your plans for the future</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Port Albert, Auckland, June 21, 1864, with reference to some business proposition: <cite><q>I have tried to work on the minds of one or another so that you may attain your object if possible. There will be lower tenders than 70 pounds, but in commission with Mr E. you might be able to get it......You must induce Tom to come to Auckland..... Should you get the mail, or no, you may work together. He to come and take a situation for a time; thee the same, should thou not succeed; then to see your way; and should thou not like to go down altogether, to go down now and just to keep him right, thee to have an interest in it. Thee, with thy garden and thy present stock, would bring in a comfortable living. He must meet thee there.......Tell Tom he must lay aside the prejudice his wife feels, and walk in the way of providence...</q></cite></p>
<p>Port Albert, July 4, 1864: <cite><q>I would advise thee to unite yourself with thy Brother in some way; you will prosper, and God's blessing will rest upon you......Do not hastily rush into business; take time for thought and consideration. You would do and do well, in Auckland; but not so well as when I advised it at first. Do not begin anywhere until you have...thoroughly examined all the places Tom has named.......Intercept Tom if you can and see these places for yourself. Tom is not a good judge. Do not be drawn into buying anyone out; you can establish one of your own with less money. I would certainly recommend a few weeks in situation in either one or the other, or all these places; it will do you good and give you an insight which you could not get in any other way with a little ready money</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Auckland, February 9th 1865, with respect to a house: <cite><q>The time is favourable now for the beginning. I have only the same caution to give as you yourselves feel - that is, rent. He will be sure to succeed if willing to surmount the difficulties. The place with the house attached would do very well. I will leave it with him whether to reside there or no. ..These are points to take into consideration as money will be very scarce for a time</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Auckland August 22nd 1865: <cite><q>The present: Act cautiously. These men are unsubstantial. They are not wanting the capacity; and have some means; but they have some villians and are wanting in principle. The scheme is good, and with prudence and forethought may turn out well.....The future: Think not of leaving-I mean thy present place of business; leave it not, nor close it</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Auckland October 20(?) 1865: <cite><q>You are my children; as such I feel for you. I cannot advise you where to go; but I see it will be best to go. As I have said before, these are things for you to arrange yourselves... Hold your materials if possible; you will require them another day.... I would advise thee to go alone...Think less of your trials. Murmur not at being unsettled. In these new countries you must go with the tide. You cannot be so stationary as in other countries. I feel most in favor of Nelson or thereabouts. You will be sure to do well unless you oppose the way of Providence. Unite your interests and your Heavenly Father will give you his blessing</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Auckland December 4th, 1865: <cite><q>My dear children, I do indeed feel with you. Like the Children of Israel, driven hither and thither because you have first departed from my love-I mean that I wished your interests to be bound in one...If Tom will not or cannot join you in anything you must join him. Have you not observed that both your troubles come at once...I would advise seeing a lawyer before seeing this hard man[?]. Though in trouble, not in disgrace, he ought not to extract so much from you....He (C) is a hard man but God will give you strength..When I advised Tom's coming to Auckland, you would have gained a footing and done well; but he would not; therefore trouble came upon you both to force you together. It was for this I advised your coming to New Zealand...Write to him kindly; I am sure he will meet you..Detain Mary a little longer, 'til you see your way better</q></cite>. [End of communications recorded in Auckland]</p>
<p>The <em>Dictionary of New Zealand Biography</em> have Thomas and Samuel in Blenheim round about April 1866-first edition of <em>Marlborough Express.</em> Tom was still in Picton in December 1865 as one of his letters to Mary shows. [see below]</p>
<h2>Samuel's correspondence continues:</h2>
<p>Blenheim, Marlboro', date uncertain: <cite><q>My dear children. Why let this appearance of evil so depress you? I say as I said before: with the paper you will do very well; with manly courage and God's blessing you will be sure to succeed...I know thy brother is hard to deal with; but in one thing thou hast injured him and thyself, things which ought not to have been mentioned out of your own families have been made matter for public comment..The evil influences surrounging you just now would make it much better that you remain in partnership for a time-that time to be decided between yourselves, each accommodating himself to the other</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Another undated message, possibly October 1866: <cite><q>Hast thou forgiven thy Brother seventy times seven? Dost thou always give him a soft answer which turneth away wrath? He wrongs thee sometimes so does thou him. You cannot work together with your present feelings. He is prompted to envy and jealousy.....As to Tom: unless a change comes over him he will certainly bring ruin upon himself...Deal justly with thy beother, as thou expects to be forgiven</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim, Marlboro', August 3, 1866: <cite><q>You have tried to work together; your interests are one, but your method and opinions differ. I would recomend that you divide your interests ....I would suggest, if you cannot divide, your taking separtae branches; thee taking one, managing, directing, controlling and finishing; he taking the other- for yourselves alone, gradually separating yourselves as much as you can....It is your duty to push forward the paper by all the means in your power; I mean, honestly. The novelty is subsiding. You will have to make a great effort to keep it at its present circulation. I would say: spare no effort. In this lie the springs of all else</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim, Marlboro': August 7, 1866: <cite><q>I mention that Tom proposes to set a value on the copyright of the 'Express' when we divide, which would be practically, a tax on my brains; and his desire to keep it in his own hands and print it for me'..`With repect to the first, such a thing would be very unjust; and, as to the second, you would be better apart, entirely....His branch of the busines has, is, and will be for some time the most profitable-yours depending your own exertions. Still I would say, be apart, the seeds of discord are so thickly sown. I fear you cannot work together...I leave such matters to your judgement; what ever course will improve the paper, hesitate not if within thy means</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim, Marlbro, Nov 17, 1866: <cite><q>As to this new plan, or desired new arrangement, I cannot recommend any change from your present course. Tell Tom I cannot sanction a change. Do so if you will; your reward will follow. You are making steady progress; be content therewith. Let the change be in your own hearts. I speak to both</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim, Marlbro, Sept 12, 1866(?): <cite><q>Meet as brothers..I do not understand your business, how this is to be done, I must leave it to yourselves. Avoid quarrelling, lest He incite you in His anger</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim (no date): <cite><q>Tell Tom, This fictitious valuation is false to himself and unjust to you. And again, there can be no depreciation on materials never used....I cannot value your type, or price this or that; but I would advise you to be just to one another..It is only just and right that he pay a morety(?) of the rent. Be not hard on one another but you must deal justly with one another, remembering that you are brothers...Be good; He will make you great. See what He hath done for you in the past year. Be thankful, lest He be angry</q></cite>.</p>
<p>Blenheim, Marlbro, Feb 25, 1867: <cite><q>Meet this morning and understand each other. Be plain: have no hidden meanings; each saying what you are willing to do.If you cannot agree, I would advise you to pass the affair into other hands; as this matter will interfere with your peace through life, if not satisfactorily settled....The value of service I would not have entertained, each being supposed to have done what he could. The rent is a fair question, with all other expenses incurred by you, jointly or separate, having any bearing on the business.. Show Tom this. These little matters will be much better arranged among yourselves, as they tend to create prejudice, for or against</q></cite>.</p>
<p>This is the end of the diary as handed down to their descendants. Both brothers seem to have recourse to the same medium; who sometimes speaks as though it is their mother. Both brothers exchange messages. The immediacy of some of the information suggests some kind of medium (in the absence of the telegraph) as the medium responds to problems as they occur. It has to be remembered the turnaround of letters in the 1860s would have been 6 months at the minimum, possibly more. While the places and dates are absolutely correct, it is hard to see how someone in Britain, or a medium associated with Britain, can make judgements about life in New Zealand. Sometimes the person replying admits this.</p>
<p>To close this period of Thomas' life, we can quote the letters, which survive. He wrote to Mary from Picton in December 1865. It is apparent he has left Dunedin and the business there; that Mary appears to be staying with Samuel's family, possibly in Auckland; and Samuel himself is in Auckland looking for opportunities. Thomas appears to be negotiating a printing and mail contract in Picton with a Mr W H Eyes who the <em>Dictionary of Biography</em> identifies as a member of the Marlborough Provincial Council (Provincial Councils were abolished in 1876).</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>Picton, Sunday, Dec. 3rd.1865.<br />
My dear Wife<br />
...My mind is soothed by the quiet and beauty of this place, and I do feel at peace - to look back on our married life. I see many cases but in the midst of all, we have enjoyed a measure of comfort - domestic comfort - which few people enjoy, and even in Auckland, have we not enjoyed many blessings. And now, although our means are small, although I sometimes in looking to what is likely to occur feel for a moment troubled because I cannot see my way, and because my money is limited to a pound or two - yet I feel comfortable in my mind and believe that He, who has never failed me from my youth up, He, who has led me these many years through difficult ways, will still lead me on....Thy sister will be taken care of whether she comes or not. Yea, and though thy father and Mother be left in a sense alone, still trust on - all will be well.</q></cite></p>
<p>A brother turns up later in Wellington. He must be the Michael who has been mentioned before. Ralph Johnson has traced an assisted emigrant of this name arriving in Dunedin on 21 August 1871</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>Picton, Saturday December 9th<br />
My dear Mary<br />
As I said in a former letter, I wrote to Mr Eyes on Monday last telling him, that I could not undertake to print a newspaper, but that I would commence a Jobbing office, and in a while probably my Brother would join me, and then I could manage a paper. Of course, in consideration of the Government work etc....On Thursday I got a note from him appointing to meet me at one of the Hotels here. I went over and had a few minutes conversation with him. He expressed himself satisfied that all was correct on my part, that he would make some arrangements on his return and either write to me or he would be coming over again in a week. I expect I may succeed in a loan of at least 50 pounds, perhaps more, and I have no doubt of the result. When I saw him first I referred him to Mr Luckie of Nelson, and he wrote to him and had received a very flattering reply for which I am very much obliged to him. So thou sees God can raise us up friends where we least expected. He said that the place he formerly thought of was occupied. I named another which he thought we could get.- I am to commence a Jobbing business, of course, some or all of the Government work, and when Saml comes probably by that time the other paper will be dead, and we shall be able to commence another. I shall not know perhaps till next week how I am to do about the things, but I expect I shall know then, when I shall lose no time in sending. I hope we may get them down to start with the New Year....As respects thy coming - just please thyself - I should be glad tthou were here, but I leave it with thee....I have not yet heard from Michael.... I enclose a note for Saml, which read, and pass on to him....Give my love to Thyrza and Hannah and tell them I hope to see them all again soon, and hope the next move may be the last one. PS. If thou should not be started when I send final word for the things - try to get a Royal Arms from Mr Atkin, and pay him for it and bring it with you</q></cite>.</p>
<p>[A Royal Arms for the Government work presumably].</p>
<p>The negotiations succeeded and Thomas and Samuel went to Blenheim in early 1866.</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>When two printer brothers, Samuel and Thomas Johnson, were looking for a place in which to set up business early in 1866, talk of the promising Wakamarina goldfield attracted them to Marlborough. By this time the seat of provincial administration had been switched back to Blenheim, so they chose the untidy little village at a river junction on the Wairau Plain as their headquarters. From a little office in Alfred St the first issue of the 'Express' emerged on Saturday, April 21, 1866, its leading article declaring the proprietors? aim to establish a well-conducted paper that shall contain the most recent information on all subjects of general interest... Less than a year later, Thomas Johnson withdrew and Samuel carried on as sole proprietor</q></cite>. (Marlborough Express April 21 1966).</p>
<h2>The Next Phase</h2>
<p>We have no direct records of Thomas' movements for the next 10 years. With the aid of my nephew, Ralph, we have traced his business enterprise in Wise's Directories to St Andrew Street, Dunedin (he is listed as a Compositor) in 1869/70. In 1872/73 he is listed at at Maitland St. [St Andrew St. was where Thomas and Mary got married]. Then in 1875/76, he is is listed in Wise's Directory in Arrowtown. There is another gap to 1878/79 when he is listed as a printer in Mulgrave Street in Wellington. His business is located in Willis Street in 1883/84.</p>
<p>Research on the Electoral Rolls show a listing of Thomas and Sam. Johnson at 4 Maclaggan St. Dunedin for 1866, 1867, 1868 and 1871/72. But in 1870, 1873 1874 and 1875 a Thomas Johnson is listed St Andrew St. again. This raises the possibility of two Thomas Johnsons, though clearly St Andrew St. is shown on the marriage entry at Knox Church.</p>
<p>From 1881, various documents survive which show that in Welllington Thomas was employed by the Government Printing Office, then worked for a printing and publishing firm called Lyon and Blair which was later bought out by Whitcombe and Tombs, and then had a second period at Government Print as a reader. He worked up to his death in 1905.</p>
<p>Details of Thomas Johnson's life after 1867 remain unrecorded (except for the Wise's Directories) until documents about printing work in Wellington dated August 20 1881 turn up. We know from letters he wrote to Karen Hansen in 1883 that he had a printing shop in Willis St. at that time (He appears in the 1878/79 Directory as a printer in Mulgrave Street; in the 1883/84 Directory he is located in Willis Street) and there is also a photograph of the print shop surviving. Just when he sold the print business is not clear as John Johnson says his father worked as a reader at the Government Printing Office as far back as he could remember. The <em>Marlborough Express</em> says he sold his shop to Whitcomb and Tombs, though this could be related to another period in his life (see later).</p>
<p>On 20 August 1881, on New Zealand Government notepaper, F. P. Murray, Private Secretary, writes to Mr Thomas Johnson:</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>In reply to your letter of the 24th inst. I can have no hesitation in stating that the 'reading'. of the somewhat difficult and intricate Fijian copy printed during the last few months for His Excellency in the Government Printing Office, has been very well and carefully done, and that the proofs sent up to me have seldom required any large amount of correction. ..You will understand that as I receive the proofs through Mr Didsbury, the head of your office, I can of course express no opinion as to your personal share in the work. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, F P Murray, Private Secretary.</q></cite>.</p>
<p>So here we have Thomas located in the Government Printing Office [1881] and having the nerve to ask officialdom for a personal reference! (He is now 47 years old).</p>
<h2>Death of Mary</h2>
<p>Significant changes took place after Mary Flinn died in Wellington in 1882. The death certificate (in posession of Nedra Johnson) shows that she was 58 when she died. The cause of death is given as 'general exhaustion of vital powers'. She was born in Ireland and had not been married previously. Her parents were Thomas and Catherine Flinn and his occupation was 'labourer'. She arrived in New Zealand on 6<sup>th</sup> October 1862 on the <em>Jura</em> and was 29-30 years old at her marriage in 1863. She is buried in Thomas Johnson family plot in Bolton Street Cemetery, Wellington, 10 March 1882. The plot is registered with the City Council in her name. Her name does not appear on the present headstone and has been replaced by Thomas (died 1905) and Karen Hansen (died 1912), Thomas' second wife. Mary is recorded in the memorial shrine in the Bolton Street Cemetery. Mary had no issue.</p>
<p>We next have copies of the two letters Thomas wrote to Karen Hansen on 14th May and 21st May 1883. The purpose of these letters was to get her to go out with him and later get married. However on 21 May he writes from Willis St Wellington <cite><q>...I send you a view of my place and shall be glad if you will call whenever you may have occasion to come to town, you will easily find it.</q></cite> [I think we have a copy of the picture and it shows a man and a boy outside a one story shop with a big notice Printing Office-the man in the doorway definitely looks like Thomas].</p>
<p>I interpret this as Thomas has left the Government Printing Office and set up on his own again. After marrying Karen on 5th July 1883, he must have sold up sometime later because in early 1885 he and Karen go to Japan and he borrows money from Michael Flynn and uses the deed to Mary's grave as security. There is a letter from Thomas to Frank [Francis] Johnson from Hong Kong dated 9th June 1885 to say they were on their way home. The deed was re-assigned to Thomas on December 24th 1887.</p>
<h2>Karen Hansen</h2>
<p>We do not have records of Karen's life before she emigrated to New Zealand from Denmark in 1875. We know that a mixed lot of European emigrants, including Karen and a friend, departed Hamburg on the vessel <em>Shakespeare</em> on October 7 1875 (see below). The Tessa Duder book, published in 2002, says the Italians on board the <em>Herschel</em> and the vessels following were recruited under the Vogel Scheme by a Mr John Glyn from the Livorno area of Tuscany.</p>
<p>Tessa Duder writes out some of the details of the Vogel Scheme and its recruitment methods on the continent that may well illustrate the information the Hansen family were attracted by. Glyn translated into Italian the official handbook for intending English emigrants compiled by J. Vogel CMG , Prime Minister of New Zeaand.</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>An abbreviated description of the above-mentioned colony and its provinces , intended as information for those who intend to emigrate to the Colony of New Zealand, and a desire to profit from a free passage and other advantages offered by the Colonial Government with the addition of a description of the climate and the products of this splendid country.</q></cite></p>
<p>John Johnson was in touch with a Mrs Hannah Moller about his parents in 1960. Mrs Moller wrote to John on 29 August:</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>Your mother and mine came out in the Shakespeare in the year 1875 or 1876. When the passengers came off they all marched to the barracks in Buckle St. Their first place[ment] was in the National Hotel which is still standing in Lambton Quay. They did not stay there long because the place was over-run with rats. As neither of our mothers could speak English it was a very hard life for them. Your mother got a place at the aslylum and that was when your poor mother lost nearly all her hair. After that they both got work at the Government house as two laundry maids/ one washing and the other ironing, but still life was hard, but your Mother picked up English much quicker than my mother.</q></cite></p>
<p>We next have a record of a Sister Hanson (sic) joining the International Order of Good Templars dated 8<sup>th</sup> day of July 1878, in Wellington.</p>
<p>Next a telegram, dated 2-9-81 addressed to Karen Hansen, care of Miss Kelly, Palmerston North. <cite><q>The situation of Head laundry maid is vacant at Govt House wages 45 pounds per year. That will suit Karen Hansen answer paid. Edward Abbey, Govt House.</q></cite></p>
<p>Then we have a telegram to Mrs Hanson (sic), Govt House Wellington, dated 16-6-2 [1882), saying "We shall be home to lunch tomorrow", signed L.P. Knollys, Major, ADC. We know that 'housemaid' appears on the marriage certificate in 1883.</p>
<p>Next, there is a personal reference from Government House dated August 18 1882. <cite><q>Karen Hansen has lived at Government House as laundress for a year. Lady Hamilton Gordon can give her the highest recommendation. she is a first-rate laundress. She has always found her work obliging and punctual in her work. Signed Rachel Hamilton Gordon</q></cite>.</p>
<h2>New Directions</h2>
<p>There is a letter to Karen Hansen surviving dated 14<sup>th</sup> May 1883 from a Thomas Johnson, Printer.</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>You will doubtless remember me as occasionally in your company when you were living in Thorndon, on returning from Chapel on a Sunday. I write now to ask if you will give me a few minutes conversation some time this week, at your convenience. If you would mention a time I would meet you and walk down with you; or I would meet you at say Mrs Jacobson's house, or as you might suggest. Any time you could name would be equally convenient to myself. Yours respectfully, Thomas Johnson.</q></cite></p>
<p>A week late a second letter survives;</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>I write to say that all being well I will meet you a little earlier than I mentioned yesterday. I will come by the first tram from here after 3 o'clock. But do not put yourself about in any way to meet me. Come as convenient to yourself. I do not know your times for meals and so on so it might have been managed better. Perhaps you may see your way to arrange with someone to take a few hours for you on Thursday night, so that you could get to the tea. If not, perhaps a run to the Hutt and back would be a pleasant change for you? I should be glad to accompany you. I think you could get back in time. I send you a view of my place, and shall be glad if you will call whenever you may have occasion to come to town, you will easily find it. Also a book or two, to read or lend to others, as you see fit. Yours faithfully, Thomas Johnson.</q></cite></p>
<p>According to an old invoice, the name of Thomas' business in Willis St. was "Law, Parliamentary, Medical and Commercial Printing Office (formerly the New Zealand Times Printing Office)".</p>
<h2>Farewell to Service</h2>
<p>Apart from the wedding certificate for 5<sup>th</sup> July 1883, we do not know how fast events proceeded. Apparently Karen worked at Wellington Hospital after her marriage; we have a reference dated December 31<sup>st</sup> 1884 from the Lady Superintendent;</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>I have much pleasure in testifying to the excellent and sterling qualities of Mrs Johnson, and consider that she is a very valuable sick nurse. She worked under my charge for 8 months, more especially as night nurse, and soon(?) the regards of all new patients for her increasing care and thoughtfulness. Signed, Mrs Bernard Moore, Lady Superintendent.</q></cite></p>
<p>Apparently Thomas and Karen went off to Japan soon after she left service in the hospital. There is a document dated 3<sup>rd</sup> February 1885 assigning Thomas? interest in Mary Flinn?s grave to his brother-in-law Michael Flinn. This took place in Napier. [The document was re-assigned back to Thomas on December 4 1887.]. There is a surviving letter written in Hong Kong on 9<sup>th</sup> June 1885 to Frank [Francis Johnson, son of Samuel] It says</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>I just sit down to tell you that we arrived safely here on Sunday, and all being well will sail for Sydney by the 'SS Taiwan' on Wednesday morning early. I am busy transshipping my goods now. Theres no place I see like New Zealand. I am taking out a draft for Wellington for 250 pounds and may enclose, With best love,Thomas Johnson</q></cite>.</p>
<p>On the 12<sup>th</sup> July 1885, Hannah was born back in Wellington. The birth certificate shows the address as Barker St.</p>
<h2>Back to Business</h2>
<p>In 1883 [19th September] we have a copy of a reference for Thomas from the Government Printing Office:</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>Having intimated to me your intention of applying for the appointment of Government Printer of Fiji, I have great pleasure in stating that from your extensive and varied experience in connection with the printing trade, and from my personal knowledge of your capabilities during the period you were employed under me in this Dept., I can confidentially recommend you for the appointment you aspire to. Added to your thorough knowledge of the business, you posess other recommendations which should have their due weight in determining your eligibility for the appointment, namely your methodical and orderly habits , sobriety, and industry. Your services were utilised in various capacities while employed here - as compositor, leader, computor, etc in all of which you aquitted yourself creditably. I should be glad to hear of your success in obtaining the appointment you seek. Yours faithfully, Geo Didsbury, Government printer</q></cite></p>
<p>On the back of the letter is another reference dated September 21 1883 from Mr Thomas Dick, Colonial Secretary.</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>I have known Mr Johnston for many years and although unable to speak of his qualifications as a printer I can state that he is most respectable and trustworthy and has always conducted himself in such a way as to merit the confidence of his employers</q></cite>.</p>
<p>The key phrase in the Government Printer's reference is <cite><q>and from my personal knowledge of your capabilities during the period you were employed under me in this Dept.</q></cite> because it is in the past tense. Apparently, the bid to go to Fiji failed, and we know above that he had been working on Fiji contracts, and somewhere along the line he decides to try his luck in Japan!</p>
<p>In July 1885, Hannah is born and in December 1886 John is born. John says that the family lived in Roxburgh St., Mt Victoria as far back as he can remember.</p>
<p>In 1890 [17th July] we have a reference from Edward Tregear F.R.G.S, F.R.Hist,</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>I cannot let you leave the service of Messrs Lyon &amp; Blair without thanking you warmly for the way in which you did your work as reader while my Comparative Dictionary was going through the press. I am grateful not only for the accuracy which saved me much trouble and added to the value of the book, but also for the intelligent interest you took in your trade. I wish you many years of happiness and useful work, Yours faithfully...</q></cite></p>
<p>Then on 24th April 1894, we have a reference from Messrs Lyon and Blair:</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>We have pleasure in testifying that Mr Johnson was in our employment for a period of nearly five years during which time he discharged the duties of Reader and Corrector for the press in a concientious and satisfactory manner. Mr Johnson is a practical printer long and varied experience whose reliability and conduct is of the highest character.</q></cite></p>
<p>At the foot of this reference in Thomas's hand writing is a note:</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>By permission of the Government Printer, Mr T Johnson was selected by Mr Blair to value the Printing, Machinery and Engraving departments when disposing of his business to Messrs Whitcombe and Tombs in Nov 1 to 7, 1894; a somewhat difficult task, which was completed entirely to his satisfaction. Amount: 3,750 Pounds.</q></cite></p>
<p>From all this I gather that Thomas worked for Lyon and Blair in the period indicated [1889-94] and that he returned to Government Print some time in 1894. Lyon and Blair are described on their notepaper as "Wholesale and Retail Booksellers, Publishers, and Manufacturing Stationers". This explains the 1966 <em>Marlborough Express</em> comment that "It is believed he [Thomas] was associated with the founding of the firm which later became Whitcombe and Tombs, and though he did not participate, he was interested in the starting of the Evening Post, which last year also celebrated its centennial". It may be that the Willis St printing business was sold to Lyon and Blair in 1884.</p>
<p>Here the trail runs cold again and we have to assume Thomas saw out his working days at Government Print. There is no mention of his retirement. We only have a record of a debate he had in 1897 with the trustees of the United Christian Mission, a church group with a Chapel in Courtenay Place. Thomas is apparently secretary and treasurer of the Mission. A dispute arose between the Brothers about the doctrine of ministry; <cite><q>have all rightly instructed Christians received power of ministry?. Bro Roberts is in favour of identifying those with special gifts; Bro Johnson was in favour of full liberty of conscience. At a meeting Bro Roberts took a vote and got full support; Bro Johnson resigns his positions</q></cite>.</p>
<p>John Johnson says that <cite><q>On Sundays I accompanied my father to a United Christian Mission which he and some other evangelicals ran but it broke up though dissension and later I attended the Vivian St. Baptist Sunday School and Church which gave me a definite Christian faith on Nonconformist lines</q></cite> (<em>My Story,</em> MS).</p>
<p>In 1899 Thomas was invited to become vice-president of the Wellington British Israel Association.The association had the object "to promulgate the important truth that the British Empire and United States of America are the nations and people into which it was predicted by Jacob, and also by Moses that the House of Israel would develop in the 'latter days' ". There are no further records.</p>
<p>Thomas Johnson died on 2nd November 1905 and is buried in the Bolton St Cemetery alongside his two wives. Their part of the cemetery was preserved when the motorway was constructed in the 1960s.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>The two non-conformist brothers present a typical record of lower middle class/upper working class migrants in the 19th century. The powerful influence of the non-conformist churches in the north of England in the mid century clearly dictated forthright and independent yeoman-based views of the society and the world around them. Its a pity we have little record of their views on migration to the new world. As a result of the same influences, both brothers appear to be believers in aspects of spiritualism and prepared to consult a medium if occasion demands. Again its a pity that the records of these sessions reveal so little about their origins.</p>
<p>In the new world, both brothers suffer setbacks and misfortunes (sometimes at the hands of others) but both achieve some measure of respectability too. Samuel for his newspaper and provincial council work and Thomas for his tradesman-like devotion to the job in hand. We know little of Samuel?s spiritual development though one must assume he was a driven by ideas as was Thomas. We see Thomas playing with religious belief, and understanding it, from an early age and still prepared to stand by his principles toward the end of his life. And finally, sucessful family men too, both leaving children who maintained the line and name but also preserved in many ways their strictly non-conformist approach to life! What a lot the north of England has to be proud of.</p>
