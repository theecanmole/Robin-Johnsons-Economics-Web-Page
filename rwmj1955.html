<h1>The aggregate supply of New Zealand farm products*</h1>
<p></p>
<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
<p class="just">A complete agricultural
supply model would be defined as a system of equations describing
the flow of farm products on to the market. A statistical model is
an approximation to the exact relations we put forward in theory,
and any single equation we care to consider is an abstraction from
the general interdependence of the economic system. The first
source of error lies in the aggregate nature of macro-economics. We
may expect a reasonable degree of causation between a change in
price of a single factor or product and the resulting output, but
when output is an aggregate of many different products, each
related to its own system of inputs, a certain loss of exactness is
inevitable. Second, errors of measurement arise where the yearly
definition of variables is made on an arbitrary basis. Farm output
and certain seasonal farm inputs, being governed by regular
patterns of biological growth, lend themselves to independent
yearly observation, but in the case of a price series there may be
no clear demarcation between two successive periods of measurement.
The use of time series introduces a further error in that the
population being sampled may also be subject to change. In
particular, it is difficult to allow for the effect of changing
techniques over a period of time.</p>
<p class="just">The approximate nature of our
equations is recognized by the introduction of a stochastic
variable to take care of "unexplainable" variation, whether it
arises from inaccurate measurement of a single variable or from the
neglect of an important determining variable. The effect of changes
in technology can be allowed for by introducing a linear time
variable. This implies a constant rate of change only and, as such,
may act as a catch-all for all sorts of temporary and permanent
influences. On the other hand some form of transformation of the
variables may overcome this problem.</p>
<p class="just">The final form of our model
is not defined in any precise way, as a number of different lagged
values of the independent variables may operate at different times
and places. Hence the procedure followed in this article represents a
course of trial and error rather than the measurement of fairly
rigorously defined postulates. The following section is a brief review
of statistical methodology related to single equations, followed by
estimates of the supply parameters obtained.</p>

<h4>2. Statistical Problems</h4>

<p class="just">If we are to apply tests of
significance to parameters estimated by the method of least squares
we require the error terms of the regression equation to be random and
normally distributed. The presence of a systematic element in the
residuals (serial correlation) will mean that the error terms fail
to meet the assumption of independence. The problem may sometimes
be overcome, however, by the use of first differences of the
original values, as suggested by Cochrane and Orcutt.<sup>1</sup> Testing the
residuals so obtained can be carried out with the Von Neumann
ratio,<sup>2</sup> or with the distribution prepared by Durbin and
Watson<sup>3</sup> for a model with the error term randomly
distributed.</p>
<p class="just">Further, the presence of more
than one independent linear relationship between the determining
variables in the regression equation (multicollinearity) may lead
to uncertain regression coefficients.<sup>4</sup> As we are more
interested in the structural relationships than prediction, this
consideration is most important. Where the variables are subject to
errors of measurement (as is usual) the position is particularly
acute, as any regression coefficients obtained will measure partly
or wholly the influence of random error terms in the direction in
which an actual linear relationship exists.<sup>5</sup> They will
be further distorted, of course, if vve do not correct for serial
correlation. As Stone points out,<sup>6</sup> this situation is not
necessarily reflected in the standard errors of the regression
coefficients. An indication that such a relationship is present is
given by unstable or changing partial regression coefficients when
a new variable is added. In the following analysis, some general
hypotheses are first
tested without examining the data for multicollinearity, but the
final results are based on an equation selected by means of
confluence analysis.</p>
<p class="just">
The problem of the errors has
already been outlined. Those arising in the process of collection
and classification represent the lack of accurate measurement of
well-known economic quantities; such errors are increased, of
course, when we are forced to rely on substitute criteria. Errors
of the equation arise out of the failure to find a complete explanation for the
variation of the dependent variable from</p>

its mean. There may be the
possibility that an explanatory variable has been neglected, or the
lack of complete explanation may be attributed to variables which do not
have a constant effect over the period, or to those variables which
we know have certain causal relations with the dependent variable
but do not yield to statistical measurement.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p class="just">
The problem of identifying
either a demand or a supply relation-ship does not arise as
current prices are not related to production in the analysis. All the
determining variables are fitted with lags corresponding to the known production
period as closely as the data permits with the exception of &ldquo;current&rdquo;
rainfall.</p>
<p class="just">
Apart from statistical
requirements, the economic meaning of our data is most closely
approximated by the use of a logarithmic transformation. Thus in
the equations which follow, the regression coefficients measure
elasticities directly, i.e. they indicate the percentage change in output, which will,
on average, result from a 1 per cent increase
in the input of various factors. The regression model has the
general form:</p>
<p>(log X<sub>1t</sub> - log X<sub>1t - 1</sub> = K + b<sub>12</sub>(log X<sub>2t</sub> - log X<sub>2t - 1</sub>) 
+ b<sub>13</sub>(log X<sub>3t</sub> - log X<sub>3t - 1</sub>) + U<sub>t</sub> </p>

<p>where </p>

<p class="just">X<sub>1t</sub> is the dependent variable in period t,</p>
<p class="just">X<sub>2t</sub>, X<sub>3t</sub> the independent variables in period t,</p>

<p class="just">X<sub>1t - 1</sub>, - X<sub>2t - 1</sub>, X<sub>3t - 1</sub> the
corresponding values in period t - 1,

<p class="just">b<sub>12</sub>, b<sub>13</sub> the regression coefficients calculated from
the the first differences of logs.</p>
<p class="just">
<p class="just">K a constant,</p>
<p class="just">and U<sub>t</sub> a random error term of zero
mean and finite variance.</p>

<p class="just">
We may conclude this section
with some comments on the selection of variables for the final
supply equation. However many relationships we postulate in theory
it is almost certain that with such short time series as in general
are available, the number of significant relationships in the statistical sense
will be somewhat limited. Thus some process of selection is
inferred in many cases without any actual statement to that effect.
The method used in the present work is the ordinary 5 per cent
fiducial limit. A considerable number of different factors which
might influence the supply of farm products were thus tested by
simple and multiple correlation to determine where the greatest
degree of causation appeared to lie.</p>

As might be expected from the coefficients of determination in Table I, the use of the first
difference transformation in Table II has resulted
in fairly large errors of the equation in each case. This is partly
explained by the lack of
suitable variables besides those considered, but must largely be
attributed to the use of the first difference transformation with a variable, namely,
rainfall, which is particularly subject to errors of
measurement.</p>

<p class="just">The addition of one or other
of the price variables by itself appears to add very little to the
variance explained in equation (1.1b). The deflated series might be
said to be the more significant of the two, but at such low levels
of significance that a conclusion is exceedingly tentative. This
result is corroborated, however, by the improvement in the
explanation when top-dressing is introduced.<sup>11</sup> The two-year
response also shows out more clearly. 
It will be noted that the deflated <i>b</i><sub>15</sub>
is significant at the 5 per cent level in equations (1.5a) and (1.6a) while <i>b</i><sub>14</sub>
and <i>b></i><sub>16</sub> are not. Such a relationship is rather suspect from the statistical point of view, for with
successive manipulations of such a short
series, we can expect sooner or later a significant relation at
the 5 per cent level to turn
up purely by chance. There is also the problem of multicollinearity
to be taken into account. We propose to deal with it
below.</p>
<p class="just">
Our preliminary conclusion,
at this stage, is that we have failed to isolate any real price
influences in the farm production series. We have only a negative
indication that the supply function of New Zealand agriculture is
highly inelastic. In other words, not only is the supply of farm
products independent of the current market situation, but it also
tends to be independent even of previous market
situations.</p>

The normalized regression
slopes are set out in Diagram 1. The set (123) is given in equation
(3.1). The addition of price in (1234) (equation 3.2) indicates
that the resulting equation is multicollinear. We are not in a
position therefore to use any price elasticity so obtained for policy purposes, as it
must necessarily be influenced by the presence of an &ldquo;unexpected

Since top-dressing data has only been
collected from 1926, the rest of this analysis is restricted to the
26-year period 1926-52. Diagram II sets out the results of the
confluence analysis. The subscripts 1, 2, 3, 4, remain the same as in the 33-year analysis, top-dressing
being designated X<sub>5</sub> in this case. The number of
different price situations has been narrowed down to the single

computations within reasonable bounds. Possible equations are

From Diagram II, however, we
see that not all of the above equations are acceptable owing to a
suspicion of multicollinearity. The only consistent three-set is
(123) and as the higher sets are not satisfactory we are forced
back to the same group of variables in equation 1.1b of Table
I.</p>

<h4>5. Discussion</h4>
<p class="just">
This last result indicates
that yearly variations in the supply of butterfat are more related
to climatic changes than to changes in price the preceding year.
Although the Waikato basin is not entirely given over to dairy
production (the ratio of milking cows to sheep is 1: 2 - 9) the
lack of price responses suggests that butterfat output tends to
behave like an aggregate itself, rather than as a price-sensitive
component of the
national aggregate. The reason for this lies, of course, in the
immense natural advantages that this grassland dairying pattern has
over other possible alternatives at present-day prices.</p>

<p class="just">In general the failure to
isolate some chain of causation between changes in price and
subsequent changes in output supports the hypothesis that dairy output can be
regarded as an autonomous variable in any future New Zealand
studies in econometrics. Clearly some other types of farm
production than dairying may still remain exceedingly sensitive to
market changes and in such cases could not be regarded as wholly
predetermined.</p>
<p class="just">
The low values obtained for
the partial regression coefficients of price on production at least
indicate that the one-year supply curve of agriculture is nearly
vertical and that in some periods of years it leans somewhat to the
left and in others somewhat to the right. The positive slope of
dairy output for 1919-52 is a reflection of rapid development in the early 'twenties
when, by and large, prices were also favourable. The negative slope
for 1926-52 is a reflection, on the other hand, of the depression
when marked climatic rises in butterfat production were associated with unfavourable movements in prices. Since 1940, the slope has
undoubtedly moved over to the right again. These conclusions fit
quite satisfactorily into some of the recently published work of W.
W. Cochrane in the U.S.A.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p class="just">
The mechanism by which
farmers adjust production requires some comment. Changes in price
may have two effects which, in a single product type of farm such
as a dairy farm, tend to counteract one another. Higher prices may
tend to increase marginal inputs in accordance with marginal productivity
theory but, at the same time, the higher income reduces pressure
upon the farmer and probably causes him to take some of his
increased real income in the form of leisure.</p>
<p class="just">
Finally the period of years
selected must influence the resulting regression. Since 1918 there
have been so many and so marked technological and economic changes in
the population we have been measuring that any assumption of a
homogeneous or stable economic structure is almost certainly wrong.
These considerations point to the analysis of a reasonably short
period of time, certainly much shorter than that strictly required
for a time series analysis. In the long run increases in farm
output are dependent on the direct adoption of new techniques
whatever the particular stimulus for such changes happens to
be.</p>
