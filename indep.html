<h1>Infrastructure Woes</h1>
<p>The article on 'Infrastructure stuck in the slow lane'
(<i>Independent</i> 8 March 2006) reminds me of some earlier
research on investment in the economy (<i>Independent</i> 29 Sept
1999). At that time Bob Edlin quoted my research showing that the
period before the 1984 election has been characterised by high
investment in a wide range of sectors with consequential benefits
to sector productivity. Most rapid expansion of assets was in
fishing, mining, chemicals, metals, energy, transport and
communications. After 1984 the annual rate of investment in assets
slowed considerably. Those sectors that were still investing in the
economy included fishing, chemicals, basic metals, communications,
finance and community services.</p>
<p>As the graph in the recent article demonstrates, the transport
sector and the energy sector did not feature in this latter period.
In the NZIER study this is shown as the ratio of gross capital
formation in each sector to GDP as a whole, whereas the above data
refers to the gross capital stock in each sector after investment
was added but depreciation deducted. The latter data was derived
from the work of Professor Philpott.</p>
<p>More recent data on capital stocks in use using the same capital
formation data shows that the real stock of energy capital
increased by 8.5 per cent in the period 1984-95 and by 5 percent
from 1996 to 2003. Transport capital fell by 12 percent between
1984 and 1995 but rose by 1 percent between 1996 and 2003.
Communications capital rose by 69 per cent in the first period and
by 57 per cent in the more recent period. Over the periods
1984-95 and 1996-03, real national income increased by 12 and -4
per cent in energy, by 36 and 31 per cent in transport and by 79
and 119 per cent in communications.</p>
<p>National statistics do not distinguish between government
investment and private investment so we have to surmise a bit to
explain the causes of these changes in investment patterns. It is
clear that transport and energy are usually seen as the area of
government investment whereas telephones and the internet have
largely been privatised since 1984. More generally, the decline in
investment can be explained by the natural tendency to live off
depreciation and not replace assets as they wear out. The argument
can be made that it is highly desirable to put depreciation tax
allowances back into better performing assets rather than disperse
it to shareholders or whatever.</p>
<p>It seems to me that these trends in capital investment structure
have been caused by the hands-off attitude of successive
governments since 1984 and the lack of a central planning mechanism
that took into account the more longer term needs of the economy.
Roger Douglas said that privatising investment would lead to more
efficient use of capital investment. If this is right there is
something wrong with the market signals in recent years which
should be telling us that the main infrastructural assets are
wearing out viz. electricity networks, road and rail configurations
and aeroplanes to mention a few. I am a disciple of the 1984
reforms in general but in this case it seems we need to go back to
some earlier planning practices in the area of national investment
in strategic assets.</p>
