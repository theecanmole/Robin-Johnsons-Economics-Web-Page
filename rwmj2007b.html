<h1>Current Issues in Planning and Guiding Public R &amp; D:
Investment in New Zealand: Planning under Uncertainty</h1>
<p class='center'>By</p>
<p class='center'>Robin Johnson, Consulting Economist, Wellington,
New Zealand</p>
<p class='nav csmall'>Australian Agricultural and Resource
Economics Society Conference, February 13-16, 2007, Queenstown New
Zealand</p>
<p>Compared to other OECD countries New Zealand has high proportion
of government funded R &amp; D investment though a relatively low
proportion of GDP as a whole. In the 1990s it was decided to
re-organise the structure of R &amp; D organisation in NZ changing
government departments into government- owned research companies
and allocating public funds on a contestable basis through another
public agency. This paper is about models for allocating the
remaining public funding to all those who apply public and private
research institutes, universities, and any other appropriate
research organisation. The crown institutes have a declining share
of public funding and complain that the mechanisms for public
funding are discriminatory and unfair.This paper discusses the
public funding mechanism from the point of view of maximising the
social return to investment.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Up to 1990, the major government departments involved in R &amp;
D in New Zealand were the Ministry of Agriculture (MAF) and the
Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). In
conjunction with the Weather Bureau in the Ministry of Transport,
the Forest Research Institute in the Department of Forestry and the
Communicable Disease Centre in the Department of Health, the staff
and resources were re-organised into 10 subject matter crown
research institutes, AgResearch, NIWA, HortResearch, Crop &amp;
Food, Landcare, Forestry, Industrial Research, Geology, Social and
Environmental science(ESR). As well as large staff resources, some
of the institutes were allocated large farm areas which previously
belonged to the government departments. These research campuses
were known internationally for grassland and disease control
programmes viz Ruakura, Invermay, Wallaceville, Taita and
Grasslands.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST) was
created to take care of policy advice functions and the Foundation
for Research, Science and Technology (FRST) was established to
manage the contestable funds scheme. For a start, the funding
mechanism was known as the <i>Public Good</i> Science Fund (PGSF)
though this term has been dropped in later years. FRST seeks bids
for research funds according to a list of priorities established by
MoRST. In establishing major programmes of new work, the Minister
sends a Ministerial Direction to FRST outlining the goals of the
programme and a list of criteria for FRST to follow in judging
applications for funds for the purpose identified.</p>
<p>This paper first outlines the structure of present-day funding
system and the funds made available from central government, the
allocation system for public funds, and second, discusses whether
the contestable bidding system administered by FRST, can possibly
achieve some kind of <i>best</i> social return to the nation.</p>
<h2>International Comparisions</h2>

<p>In New Zealand total research expenditure has been being
maintained at around one per cent of GDP for some years. With the
reforms that have just been discussed, a declining share of
expenditure has been delivered by government institutions (Table
1). Even so, Government sources still fund around 60 per cent of
that total (including Vote Education-see Table 3). Private business
and the universities have been taking on an increasing share of
delivery as the reformers desired but public funding has varied
around the 60 per cent level since 1990-91 (Johnson 2000,
p.139).</p>

<p>However, research interests believe that a national investment
of only one per cent of GDP is a national disgrace and quote
information from other OECD countries of similar size that invest
double that amount in R &amp; D (Table 2). New Zealand ranks very
low among the reference countries quoted in the source. Over the
whole of the OECD sample of 31 countries in 2004, New Zealand was
ranked 21st for business R &amp; D expenditure, 24th for higher
education expenditure but 7th for government expenditure on R &amp;
D as a percentage of GDP. The countries with even higher government
investment in the reference year were Iceland (0.74), France
(0.36), Finland (0.34), Germany (0.34), Australia (0.33) and Korea
(0.33). The research community believes these ratios are a measure
of performance between countries (MoRST 2006). Such reasoning does
not make economic sense, the alternative is to seek reasons in the
area of rates of return on R &amp; D investment and in the over-
provision of some services by the state.</p>

<p>The government authors question whether New Zealand needs to
reach the OECD average for R &amp; D performance (MoRST 2006,
p.21). They suggest that NZ should be expected to spend less
because of the small size of the economy, the lack of large
manufacturing firms, the existing role of the CRIs and the
universities, the inward flow of R &amp; D by multinational firms,
the lack of high technology industries such as aerospace, defence
or automotive industries, and the dependence on primary production.
On the other hand, the research providers consistently state that
the overall investment is too low and the government could
contribute more to R &amp; D activity.</p>

<p>From the government point of view, it is clear that budget
decisions have consistently lowered the government share of R &amp;
D provision in terms of GDP growth. This pattern follows the policy
decisions taken in the 1990s where the burden was to be shifted to
the private sector. The research industry (or the more vocal
members of it) criticise both the total government funding amounts
and the way it has been allocated. The FRST decision processes work
by a list of qualitative criteria whose final results can only
<u>approximate</u> to a full analytical ranking consistent with
rate of return studies.</p>
<h2>Total Public Science Funding in New Zealand</h2>
<p>Figure 1 shows the structural relationships in the NZ public
science system. According to the 1990 reforms, the roles of the
funders, operators and administrators are clearly delineated.
Government funding is allocated by several organisations beside
FRST. MoRST only has an advisory role. The operators or providers
are the public and private research institutes, the universities,
some government departments and private research entities.
Influential entities in the whole system are the Crown Research
Institutes, the Association of Scientists and the Association of
University Teachers.</p>
<p>The Foundation is not the only grant giving organisation in the
system. Table 3 shows in more detail the structure of the system.
Some of the public funding tasks have been devolved over the years
to the Royal Society and the Health Research Council as well as the
Foundation. The role of purchase agents was re-defined in 1999
reforms of goals and objectives (MoRST 1999) The goals and
supporting outcomes demonstrated to providers what was expected in
making applications for funds. The 1999 statement said that this
new investment framework will require significant changes in the
nature and scope of the activities of purchase agents managing Vote
Research Science and Technology investments. Purchase agents were
to implement the new investment framework by managing and focussing
their investments in ways that contribute to target outcomes,
negotiating portfolios of Research Science and Technology
programmes to contribute to each outcome and providing an annual 'strategic analysis' to the MoRST</p>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>One can see an agent-principal problem in that R &amp; D grants
are all based on qualitative criteria and that priorities can vary
from agency to agency. Some of the possible differences may have
originated in the different formation of each of the science
purchasers at different dates. The 1999 reforms sought to look
forward to future needs (the Foresight Project) and to make
investment more enabling and less prescriptive. There had been a
lot of dissatisfaction among recipients in the 1990s as to the
directions that were being followed. It appears that the previous
framework did not have a transparent strategic direction and was
also beset by downstream implications of changes in R &amp; D
investment with regard to staffing levels and forward planning. It
is said that one in 12 applications to FRST were successful as
compared with one in four in the UK (Johnson 2006).</p>

<p>Government spending on R &amp; D is spread between Vote:
Research Science and Technology and Vote: Education. The size of
the Research Science and Technology vote has kept pace with growth
of GDP (Table 4). Currently if the Education research vote is
included, the combined votes are 0.60 per cent of GDP. The overall
Research Science and Technology vote has increased by 35 per cent
in the last six years; with innovation funds gaining share as well
as Technology New Zealand (a grant scheme). Some of these
provisions are for administration like policy advice and project
management, but the majority of the named programmes (outputs in
the jargon) are available for public tender including the crown
research institutes.(Individual programme trends in the table are
unreliable as there appear to be changes in the output
classification over the years). Vote Research Science and
Technology appears to have grown from 0.35 per cent of GDP to 0.42
per cent from 1994-95 to 2006-07. Thus central government is
financing more and more R &amp; D investment through its public
good funds but its institutes and departments are getting a
declining share of the funds made available. This has been the
general trend of government policy direction since 1990.</p>

<p>The share of public funding that is contestable is called the
Public Good Science Fund and is administered by FRST. As Table 3
shows, PGSF funding has declined from 85 per cent of Research
Science and Technology funding over the last 10 years to 70 per
cent.</p>

<h2>Investment Strategies: 1993 to the Foresight Project</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Research, Science and Technology is the chief
scientific advisor to the government of the day. It does not have
an operational role. The Foundation of Research, Science and
Technology administers the research funds although it also has a
small policy role. MoRST is required to provide a Statement of
Intent under its legislation setting out what the Minister sees as
the general direction of science funding for each forthcoming
period. FRST then administers a bidding round where all the
providers submit their research plans in advance and decisions are
reached through a series of referees and advisory committees. The
priorities for investment are thus established by MoRST and the
government in a general form but the administrative details fall on
FRST.</p>
<p>From 1992, FRST administered the public good science fund (PGSF)
system which pooled the available government funds for research and
development (R &amp; D) from a number of government departments .
The newly formed crown research institutes (CRIs), other providers,
and later the universities, were able to draw on these funds
provided they met the administrative criteria for public good
research.</p>
<p>FRST took over a research priority system that had been devised
by the DSIR. The procedure had been developed by defining a
research agenda broken down by what were called <q>output
areas</q>. <q>Output areas</q> groupings were common interest
research topics like sheep production and crop production. Within
output areas, criteria or rules were to give guidance to final
investment according to a Science and Technology Expert Panel
(STEP) report to MoRST (MoRST 1992a, p.78). There were 40 output
areas originally although these were later compressed to 19 main
categories.</p>

<p>In the final report of the Panel, they raised concerns about the
balance of research funding between research directly impacting on
economic performance, and research underpinning areas on which
economic activity depends indirectly (infrastructure research, and
the social and natural sciences) (MoRST 1992b, p.11). The report
noted that 68 per cent of PGSF funding in 1991-92 was allocated to
the <q>wealth creating</q> classes 1 to 19 (of the first list of
output classes). They stated that this class of outputs was already
well funded, but output classes 20 to 35 were more difficult to
assess because the benefits they create are less direct and can be
longer term. <u>The report recommended a shift in emphasis from
both the natural sciences and the production groups to what they
called the infrastructural group</u> (output areas 20 to 28).
<u>The implication was that <q>underpinning</q> research is more of
a public good than <q>wealth creating</q> research goods.</u></p>
<p>The Panel report recommended a productive partnership between
the public and private sector to ensure successful
commercialisation of PGSF research results. It stated that PGSF
research is more likely to be successfully adopted if the research
is planned with strong user involvement and is likely to have the
greatest chance of producing benefits to New Zealand where users
have well-established market linkages and were performing their own
research. The implication was that greater co- operation and
co-ordination between sectors would compensate for the low level of
private sector sponsorship of research (BERL 1995, p 46).</p>

<p>The report recommended that the PGSF should complement
successful private research activities where funds are used to
promote strategic and generic research and where there is a
demonstrated need for such research. Such complementarity should
not displace private research funding, the report states, or
support appropriable research. The Panel therefore recommended that
using the PGSF to complement private funding <cite><q>should be
conditional on a continuation or enhancement of funding from the
private sector</q></cite>. A practical problem was the state could
complement private sector activity without specifying whether
business was a big spender in that output area or not.
Re-allocating investment away from one set of output areas created
the risk that the gap would not be filled by private enterprise. In
addition, the relatively high so-called private investment in some
sectors was due to the fact that the industry research associations
were arbitrarily classified as <q>business</q> rather than
government even though they were all established with DSIR seed
money! The key challenge was whether public investment could be
used to trigger further private investment in a complementary way,
as well as to create conditions where the up-take of the results of
all science investment was enhanced.</p>
<p>In the MoRST instructions to FRST dated July 1997 these
objectives are reinforced by the Minister (MoRST 1997a). The
Minister noted that the organisational gains made had resulted in a
strong focus on small-scale purchasing of outputs, over relatively
short time frames, and within a rather rigid framework of rules and
procedures. FRST needed to develop a strategic, far-sighted, and
pro-active strategy for focusing on the achievement of outcomes.
<cite><q>It will be crucial to foster interactive relationships...
in publicly funded organisations and in the private sector that
together underpin a vibrant and thriving knowledge-based
society</q></cite>. With respect to encouragement of the private
sector, <cite><q>funding allocations should be managed in a way
...that does not diminish the incentives for, or displace
investment by other funders .....</q></cite></p>
<p>As the 1990s proceeded, these ministerial goals were translated
into fresh operational procedures by a wide consultative initiative
known as the Foresight Project. The Project was a consultative
process which attempted to document a vision of a desirable future
and the strategies needed to get there (MoRST website: Statement by
Minister Williamson). A new framework for establishing R &amp; D
priorities was designed to ensure that Government's investment
would be managed in a more enabling and less prescriptive way. The
new investment framework was characterised by the identification of
goals and outcomes. In summary, the science envelope goals
identified were:</p>
<ul>

<li>An Innovation goal - accelerate knowledge creation and human
capital;</li>
<li>An Economic goal - creation of value in new and improved
products;</li>
<li>An Environmental goal - knowledge that sustains a healthy
environment;</li>
<li>A Social goal - knowledge of the physical determinants of
wellbeing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The science envelope goals were to provide overall direction for
the public investment in Research Science and Technology. They were
designed to encourage <q>stakeholders</q> and purchase agents to
seek more effective delivery of desirable outcomes. The target
outcomes were 14 future desired states envisaged by the Foresight
Project that were cross-sectoral and which provided a
<q>strategic</q> context for the development of Research Science
and Technology portfolios, viz:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Wealth from new knowledge-based enterprises,</i></li>
<li><i>Innovative manufacturing and service enterprises,</i></li>
<li><i>Sustainable use of natural resources,</i></li>
<li><i>Wealth-creating food and fibre industries,</i></li>
<li><i>Future-focussed global intelligence,</i></li>
<li><i>Infrastructure for a knowledge society,</i></li>
<li><i>People with knowledge, skills and ideas,</i></li>
<li><i>Strong families and communities,</i></li>

<li><i>Maori development,</i></li>
<li><i>Vibrant culture and identity,</i></li>
<li><i>Health for all,</i></li>
<li><i>People living in safe and healthy environments,</i></li>
<li><i>Healthy, diverse and resilient ecosystems, and</i></li>
<li><i>New Zealand in the global biophysical environment</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The existing purchase agents (FRST, Health Ressearch Council
(HRC), and the Royal Society) would continue to purchase research
<q>outputs</q> in such a way that they were structured and grouped
so that they make a coherent contribution to the science envelope
goals. <q>Negotiation and relationship building are critical to a
stable long- term purchasing environment, but contestability and
fostering a diversity of ideas and approaches will remain important
aspects of the purchasing strategy</q> (ibid, p.14). FRST with its
responsibility for investments under several <q>output classes</q>

was expected to organise contracts with providers under each of the
output classes to create portfolios of Research Science and
Technology contracts that make contributions towards the target
outcomes</p>
<p>This exercise in public management clarified the goals and
strategies to be followed but changed the terminology and funding
trail considerably. The role of the purchase agents was clarified
(see below). FRST responded to the Foresight Project with clearer
guidelines for project selection (see below). The Treasury outputs
in Vote Research Science and Technology required some modification
(Appendix 2 in MoRST 1999) but the total Vote for Research Science
and Technology outputs thus defined did not increase markedly as
the earlier GDP ratios quoted demonstrated.</p>
<h2>Balancing Objectives: Scientists' View of Strategies at this
time</h2>
<p>An interesting question in strategy setting is where to set the
emphasis on different aspects of the science process itself as
compared with the Foresight consultation. This is sometimes
summarised under the headings <q>fundamental</q> and <q>applied</q>
science but I find recent stress on <q>discovery</q>,
<q>development</q> &amp; <q>commercialisation</q> to be more
instructive (Jordan and Atkinson 2003). They start with the
proposition that there is a need to produce approximately ten to
twenty discoveries in order to select one attractive one to take
through development; that the costs of development are ten times
the cost of discovery and that commercialisation costs may be ten
times those of development in the NZ situation. However, in NZ
practice, the development phase is seldom publicly funded because
it has no obvious saleable value. The challenge is to find
development funding that will not distort activities on either side
of the continuous spectrum of development and commercialisation `If
this is adopted as a driving principle i.e. supporting development
without draining discovery or misleading commercialisation, then NZ
must invest in R &amp; D appropriately and balance the spectrum
correctly. Obtaining the right investment in the specrum parts must
somehow be coordinated across the public and the private sector
funding</p>

<p>Applying this to the CRI situation, it means that there is a
conflict between the provisions of their Act to be financially
viable and the requirement to benefit NZ through science
infrastructure and research output. There is no provision for CRIs
to fund development. And PGSF does not support it sufficiently. But
government and the private sector believe CRIs have such a
development function. If money is taken from discovery, the
infrastructure is run down and eventually the discovery stock is
run down too. There is a parallel story in terms of failed bids to
PGSF. Science personnel are lost to the system and capacity for
certain types of research is run down which in turn weakens the
capacity of a CRI to bid for funds in the future. The official
response to this argument, as stated by FRST below, is that the CRI
system was supposed to adjust to new funding circumstances through
amalgamation, cooperation with other providers and seeking other
funding. This has clearly proved difficult although the CRI funding
story (outlined below) indicates there has been a large shift in
total CRI funding away from PGSF projects. To me this seems like a
lack of signals at crucial times when the new funding system was
being introduced.</p>
<h2>Project selection by strategies and house rules</h2>
<p>The purchasing agents have to rank the bids for public research
funds. For example, FRST receives Ministerial Directions from time
to time as to how they are to administer funds made available under
a particular Government approved programme. In addition they would
be in a position to develop house rules of their own to guide their
staff. These administrative decisions would require an information
base, skilled staff and evaluators which an organisation like FRST
would have in place. The whole process uses the language of public
management planning and identifies outcomes, outputs and research
portfolios in its documentation.</p>
<p>There were 4 goals and 14 target outcomes in 1999 and sector
strategies that support them which were to be used as a starting
point for developing research portfolios of contracted outputs
within the Vote Research Science and Technology. (MoRST 1999). Each
portfolio was to be designed to make an effective contribution
towards the relevant target outcome. As a first step, purchase
agents were to map their existing investments across to the target
outcomes. Portfolio design was to be the responsibitity of the
purchase agents managing Vote Research Science and Technology
investments - FRST, HRC and RSNZ. At FRST, for example, current
practice is for a strategy group to determine questions within
portfolios which are then made available as Requests for Bids
(RFBs). The portfolio is essentially an internal construction or
grouping device for setting research questions in an appropriate
context (S Campbell, FRST, pers.com). In the FRST section below
there is a discussion of how FRST defined their strategic
objectives following the Foresight project.</p>
<p>As an example, FRST has an <q>output class</q> called
<q>research for industry</q> a $205m research programme in 2004.
The outcome or goal sought is stated as <q>public good research,
science and technology that increases the competitiveness of New
Zealand industries and sectors</q> (MoRST 2004). The <q>outputs</q>

identified are:</p>
<ul>
<li><q><cite>Research whose primary objective is to advance food
and fibre-based industries and related sectors through innovation.
Research portfolios will lead to new products, processes and
services that enhance the competitiveness of these industries and
sectors;</cite></q></li>
<li><q><cite>Research whose primary objective is to advance
manufacturing and services industries and sectors through
innovation. Assists manufacturing and services industries and
sectors to innovate, and includes research on the broad factors
affecting business and economic life;</cite></q></li>
<li><q><cite>Research for the development of infrastructure to
underpin economic development. Assists infrastructure services,
such as communications, energy, water and waste, to innovate
cost-effectively. It also includes research on New Zealand's
mineral wealth and understanding of, and responses to risks faced
from New Zealand's physical hazards; and</cite></q></li>
<li><q><cite>Research consortia to facilitate public/private
research partnerships that provide early user engagement and
increase private investment in New Zealand . Research investment
will be made through user-led research consortia in partnership
with research providers</cite></q>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Government then provides in the Direction a description of
the rules it would expect in administering the programme: <i><q>As
it invests, the Foundation will give priority to portfolios of
research that meet the following criteria:</q></i></p>
<ul>

<li><i>scientific and technological quality;</i></li>
<li><i>potential benefit to New Zealand through
innovation;</i></li>
<li><i>contribution to boosting competitiveness of New Zealand
industries and sectors; or contribution to developing a robust
infrastructure to underpin economic development;</i></li>
<li><i>clearly defined partnerships and pathways to implementation
of the research outcomes; and</i></li>
<li><i>potential to build scientific and technological capability
and to increase the level of innovation within user groups
(ibid).</i></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a wide number of such outputs spread between the four
goals (some of which are shown in Table 3). There is thus a
hierarchy of outcomes, outputs and approved research portfolios.
There is no specific mention of rates of return to the nation
except for the instruction to take account of <q>potential benefit
to New Zealand through innovation</q>. One output class is
concerned with the development of infrastructure which also
includes an understanding of and response to risks faced from New
Zealand's physical hazards. At this level, there is no specific
indication of the risks or uncertainty that the proposed research
investments posess. There is thus a weak emphasis on economic
criteria in favour of strategic rules suitable for use at
administrative levels. In the FRST discussion below there is a
recognition of the risk to funders of investments not reaching
their declared potential.</p>
<p>If a financial risk analysis is not possible in the
circumstances, then presumably a social optimum might be achieved
by way of expert committees and house rules? It would then be
possible to talk about the aggregate selection and choice of
projects providing the best social rate of return. However, the
agricultural research interests indicate that they have the view
that their projects have been discriminated against throughout the
process and export sector outcomes have been ignored. Some possible
reasons for this are discussed at the end of the section on
agricultural R &amp; D.</p>

<h2>The FRST framework</h2>
<p>This section summarises FRST's portfolio investment strategy and
grouping of portfolios, generic instructions for advisory groups
and expert advisors and treatment of research bids. The Foundation
2006 investment framework comprises 18 distinct investment
portfolios grouped within five funds (Table 5). The NERF group
supports researcher-led innovation aimed at developing capability
and knowledge in new areas or applications where new industries are
emerging or yet to emerge, in order to underpin new high-technology
business opportunities. The focus of the research is on
targeted-basic research and human capital that will underpin new
enterprises and new sectors. Research for Industry group focuses on
research that will help sustain the value of current industries,
add value through new or improved products, processes and services
and to a lesser extent, create new businesses. The ERF supports
public good research, science and technology that enhances the
understanding and management of <q>our environment</q>. The SRF
supports public good research that improves societal wellbeing and
the MKDRF supports the development of research capability and
knowledge for the benefit of Maori and New Zealand (FRST
website).</p>

<p>Taking the primary production and sustainability investment
portfolio for 2006/07, the FRST file states that $18.8m per annum
is available for investing in Production, Quality and Assurance,
and $2.3m is available for Sustainable Production Systems. Funds
will be invested using a mix of contestable and negotiation
processes. The contestable process will be held in two stages viz
an initial concept phase followed by a full proposal phase for
selected concepts in 2006 and 2007. The Foundation has contacted
research organisations with contracts that are eligible for
negotiation in the 2006/07 investment round inviting them to enter
negotiation. The Foundation uses a range of expert advisors to help
assess concepts and proposals for investment. These advisors make
recommendation to the Foundation as to what to invest in. Members
of advisory groups are posted on the Net (FRST website).</p>
<p>In another file, FRST sets out generic guidelines for advisory
groups and other expert advisors (FRST website). Groups are
instructed to make concensus decisions on assessment of individual
proposals against required criteria; to recommend investments to
the Foundation and advise on risks and appropriate mitigations; and
to rank the proposals before them. Advisory groups are selected to
ensure a balance of experience and skills. They are to score
proposals against established criteria. They are to incorporate the
views of expert reviewers where these are not members of the panel
and take collective ownership of the Advisory group recommendations
and the processes used. Information should be made available as
feedback to applicants.</p>
<p>This summary indicates that the process is highly transparent
and has built-in criteria for independent assessment of proposals.
The assessment is clearly qualitative and not quantitative in
nature. It seems that investment monies available are set in
advance and hence are going to be important in setting funds going
to different portfolios. Summing up recommendations across
portfolios will bring about some form of highest social return
possible depending on the initial allocation of investment funds to
portfolios.</p>
<h2>Is Optimization Possible?</h2>
<p>The alternative to house rules for project selection is some
sort of ranking based on estimated internal rates of return or
other substitute criteria. I look at performance- based funding as
employed in the NZ universities, literature outputs as suggested by
CCMAU, and the few available studies of future internal rates of
return.</p>
<p>Hazledine and Kurniawan (2005) report a study of efficiency in
New Zealand universities using the Performance Based Research Fund
(PBRF) administered by the the Tertiary Education Commission. In
this case study the authors have data on performance ranking of
individuals and campuses and associated costs of research and
teaching which form the basis of a productivity measure comparable
between universities. Such a model would permit administrators to
deduce where the PBRF would be best spent among subject areas and
institutions. Is this the kind of model that FRST should have in
mind?</p>

<p>The process of measuring research performance for the 2003 PBRF
round was based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>scores for each of more 8000 academics in the eight
universities (and some polytechnics and colleges);</li>
<li>scores were produced by 12 <q>peer review panels</q> dealing
with subsets of academics divided into 41 subject areas;</li>
<li>scores covered research performance over 6 years
(1997-2002);</li>
<li>scores were weighted aggregates of 3 scores for each academic
<q>research output</q> (70%), <q>peer esteem</q> (15%), and

<q>contribution to research environment</q> (15%).</li>
<li>results were shown publicly only at the subject area and total
institution level (ie not for individual staff);</li>
<li>funding is based only on total institution score. (ibid,
p.156).</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors arrive at a university level ranking based on total
PBRF score per eligible staff member. Auckland University is at the
top of the Table.</p>
<p>As a measure of the universities' teaching output the authors
devised a weighted measure Arts equivalent FTEs. This is to
overcome the higher costs of teaching science and medicine. For
each subject, FTE grants from government are added to to the fee
payable by a student to get an estimate of per subject or per
faculty teaching cost. These were then weighted by the ratio of
teaching costs to Arts teaching costs to obtain total
arts-equivalent FTEs cost. For the total costs of achieving the
teaching and research outputs the authors use each universitys'
total revenue in 2002 from government funding, student fees,
research and interest income. As non-profit institutions revenues
from teaching and research activities are an appropriate measure of
total resources used. Two productivity measures result (Table 6 and
Fig 2):</p>
<ol>
<li>PBRF score per $million revenue (cost), and</li>
<li>Arts Equivalent EFTs per $million revenue.</li>

<p>The authors then explore the possibilities of re-allocating
funds between universities. The gains from re-allocation are stated
to be moderate. But the study did bring out that funding
universities on an FTE basis alone (<q>bums on seats</q>)
discriminated against high research universities (as compared, say,
with polytechnics). Under the pre-PBRF scheme, universities were
funded principally from student fees, partly paid by the
government, and also through externally funded research grants. Low
research outputs were not recognised. If enrolments fell,
government grants decreased. The PBRF system recognised research
outputs and put the research universities on a more even footing
with the teaching institutions.</p>

<p>Background: Boston (2006) notes that the formal reasons for
introducing PBRF was increasing knowledge and understanding,
increasing the quality of degree and postgraduate teaching and
increasing the level of knowledge transfer. The primary motivation
driving those in the tertiary education sector who advocated its
introduction was to find a politically acceptable means of securing
additional public resources for New Zealand's universities and in a
manner that would help protect, if not increase, the degree of
institutional and sectoral differentiation, together with the
accountability of tertiary education organisations (TEOs).</p>
<p>According to the NZ Yearbook (1993), the present system of
funding tertiary institutions was introduced in 1991. The EFTS
system funds tertiary institutions in bulk according to the number
of students and the courses those students are taking. The EFTS
subsidies differ substantially across subjects based presumably on
teaching cost differentials (Hazledine and Kurniawan 2005).
Polytechnics, colleges of education and universities receive state
subsidies for the number of equivalent full- time students in each
of the course cost categories at their institution These funded
places are provided by the government in advance of the funding
year. The funding is inclusive of capital works. There is
additional student funding called Study Right, which pays an
additional tuition subsidy for those eligible.</p>
<p>The EFTS funding system abolished detailed central
decision-making about levels of staffing, operating grants, and
capital works projects. These responsibilities were transferred to
the institutions themselves. According to NZYB in 1991 there were
25 polytechnics, 5 colleges of education, and 7 university
institutions. There are a certain number of private training
establishments also covered by the EFTS system.</p>
<p>Basically, the system of funding of all post-secondary education
in New Zealand introduced in 1991 tended to discriminate against
research activities. Education grants were paid on the basis of
students enrolled, course by course, suitably weighted for heavier
cost courses. This system favoured non-university institutions over
university institutions and <q>teaching</q> universities (and
departments) over research-oriented universities and departments.
Boston notes that during the 1990s the undifferentited nature of
the tertiary funding system, coupled with inappropriate tuition
subsidies, and a relatively lighthanded regulatory framework
contributed to a relatively rapid expansion of degree programmes
outside the university sector, especially in subject areas where
the tuition subsidies were relatively generous compared to the
costs of provision (eg commerce subjects). This reduced the
capacity of the universities to subsidise those courses for which
the tuition fees were inadequate (eg in the sciences) and their
capacity to encourage research activity. Out of these concerns came
the move to devise a new system for the funding of research based
on periodic assessments of research quality. This would ensure that
degree providers undertaking research of high quality received
funding while those producing little or no research were unable to
access the new funds. These arrangements would thus preserve the
traditional role of the full universities (<q>differentiation</q>)
and make them less dependent on enrolments for funding.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised that the PBRF scoring system helps
determine the allocation from the total appropriation for TEOs to
individual institutions. The allocation formula is based on
qualifying staff numbers in an institution weighted by a quality
rating, a subject weighting and an FTE component (B. Mischewski,
TEC, pers com). The institutions themselves have devolved
responsibility for allocating the funds received to departments
and/or research topics (Bakker &amp; Mischewski 2006). Thus the
PBRF system described above is not a formal basis of project
selection but a funding mechanism that reflect quality of research,
advanced degree completions and external research income.</p>

<p>Discussion: Can we visualise how a possible ranking scheme would
work for applications for public good R &amp; D funds? The key
would be to find an equivalent measure to PBRF scores. Do peer
reviews employed by FRST and other purchase agents produce
quantitative scoring data? Could applicants be required to submit
estimates of the implications of their projects on potential
national benefits? How does one measure national benefits?. As the
section on measurement of R &amp; D returns shows, there is not a
strong relationship between R &amp; D investment and industry
returns. The measures available are too aggregate, on the one hand,
and too uncertain in the timing of their impact, on the other. One
suggestion made before in this context is to start assessment at
the micro or project level and build more aggregate results from a
sampling or a survey basis?. FRST would doubtless answer that their
methodology encompasses all of these points.</p>
<h2>Measuring CRI performance</h2>
<p>Jordan and Atkinson (2003) emphasise the role of discovery in
the science system and question whether CRIs are maintaining this
aspect of their work under the funding system prevailing at that
time? As a measure of performance, they suggest, apparently in
agreement with CCMAU, that a meaningful and comparable benchmark is
international journal publication 1993-2002. This is also assessing
research at an institutional level and not at a project level.</p>
<p>This is shown as Table 1 in their text and in some cases
includes both NZ journals and international journals. The record is
not entirely complete back to 1993 but it does give some possible
tends. The authors say</p>
<p class="blocktext"><cite><q>We note that AgResearch over ten
years showed an increment in total journal publications, but the
number of papers in international journals indicating competitive
science, was near static, despite large revenue increases (56%)
over this time. HortResearch did not report international
publication separately for most of this time but showed a
precipitous decline in totals and at best a static result for
international publications for the last 3 years while revenue
increased 24%. The publication output for IRL was spiky but near
static in totals (revenue 54%).GNS was up and down (revenue 52%)
and NIWA had a flat total of intenational publications in the last
four years (revenue 127%). FRI showed some increase over 4 years
(revenue 38%).</q></cite></p>
<p>They conclude <cite><q>This is not a record of international
accomplishment in science which might be expected of apparently
healthily growing science institutions. Has there been a diversion
of resources?</q></cite></p>

<h2>The Foundation Responds</h2>
<p>In 2003, the Association of Scientists published a series of
papers covering allocation and sharing procedures in the science
system (NZAS, 2003(2-3)). Among the essays is a perceptive
contribution by FRST staff member N Allison (ibid, pp.84-87). The
author enlarges upon the Foundation's core responsibilities.</p>
<p>His contention is that the performance of the system as a whole
could be lifted through changes in, and improved clarity of, roles,
responsibilites and accountabilities. When decisions are made in
the wrong places, within the Research Science and Technology
system, there is likely to be an associated failure to execute
actions. Decisions need to be made by those closest to the
information and who have the incentives to perform. This requires
an understanding of the competencies and comparative strength of
key players in the system. FRST core competencies support its
ability to develop strategic research directions, run investment
processes of integrity, provide performance incentives for research
providers and advise Government on investment priorities.</p>
<p>He notes that while research papers and international
colaboration had risen in recent years, strategic partnerships
between research providers remained modest, engagement with
research users was typically poor, and public science providers
produced a relatively small output of codifed intellectual
property. There was the impression that there may not have been
large spill-over benefits for the economy from Government Research
Science and Technology investment. Recent changes to the system
still raised concerns over the uncertainty inherent in the system.
They occur in the context of low salaries for scientists relative
to similar professional groups, and a perception of a lack of
career development opportunities, reflected in student career
choices.</p>
<p>FRST saw its task as meeting the Minister's 2003 Direction
concerning more focus on pure ideas, driving innovation through
strengthened capability, and generating investment to extract
greater commercial value (Buwalda 2003). It was up to science
providers to develop the culture, skills and market relationships
to bring this about. FRST's task/role was to improve performance by
setting long-term research directions and managing associated
capabilities.</p>
<p>In terms of the Foresight project, the Foundation folded 120
Foresight Strategies developed by sector groups into 25 Strategic
Portfolio Outlines, dissociating end-user groups from the final
product. Foresight directions were then diluted through the use of
72 portfolios through which the Foundation invested funds. The
strategic role of the Foundation was to initiate a continuous
incremental process of setting and revising Research Science and
Technology directions, which could adapt and adjust to changing
opportunities and future outlook. Purchase agents had comparative
information advantages and were best placed to manage continuous
priority setting processes within policy parameters set by
government (Allison, op cit). However, FRST would never glean the
Research Science and Technology expertise, market knowledge and
relationships to develop strategies to make specific bets on
specific platforms for future research. The Foundation should set
clear but high-level objectives, such as increasing the value of
Research Science and Technology-based exports, use effective
proposal selection criteria, and then select the winners that
emerge from largely bottom-up processes as discussed earlier.</p>
<p>The role of the science providers in the public system would be
to provide increased and balanced capability to meet policy
directives for public research. In the case of redundancies,
research contracts exist between the purchaser and the research
organisations - not the research team. A key role of management is
to ensure that exposure to risk does not fall unfairly on the
shoulders of a few.<cite><q>Teams might as well contacr directly
with with FRST. Indeed the old audit-funding trail was a de facto
form of such a contract, and some researchers may have seen FRST as
their employer!(authors exclamation mark). Providers now have to
manage their exposure to risk, although FRST does assist with
making difficult transitions that result from changes in its
investment</q></cite>.(op cit).</p>
<p>This Foundation view of the world, in 2003, thus sees MoRST as
an advisory body to Ministers on the parameters governing
priority-setting processes administered by the purchase agents;
purchase agents operate incremental and continual priority setting
processes in accordnce with these parameters; such parameters would
include expectations relating to the management of national
capabilities concerning science infrastructure, and purchase agents
design investment processes to devolve decision- making to
providers where there are appropraiate incentives to perform and
adequate measures for accountability (op cit).</p>

<p>Now this is a clear statement of departmental responsibility and
roles related to earlier discussion of the whole Research Science
and Technology system. The key operatives are the portfolio
strategies which are presumably not unlike the strategies quoted
earlier for <q>research for industry</q>. Bureaucratic processes
are still required to select investments and to balance the
different requirement laid down by government. Who is to judge
whether the resulting portfolio selection (in the financial sense)
in any one year is anywhere near a social optimum?</p>
<h2>Measurement of the rate of return on R &amp; D Investment</h2>
<p>Lillis (2006) points out that assessing the contribution of R
&amp; D to sectoral and national outcomes is most difficult, and
disaggregating the contribution of R &amp; D from those of many
other inputs presents a particular challenge.He notes there is an
ongoing international debate concerning the optimum role for
governments in funding research, and in many nations the
government's role is primarily to address market failure,
supporting long-term research that the private sector either cannot
afford or from which short-term profit cannot be derived. It is
debatable whether having a high proportion of scientists in the
workforce underpins a strong economy, or whether a strong economy
provides the means for more people to engage in blue-skies
scientific work?.</p>
<p>When evaluating R &amp; D outcomes, issues of causality and
attribution (of outcomes to particular research investments) arise
frequently. In practice, he says we face great challenges in
demonstrating that particular outcomes (eg rise in GDP, increase in
sector sales) arise because of particular research investments. He
notes Hemlin (1999) states that there are no reliable methods for
assessing direct causality between public funded research and
productivity. He notes that it is usually easier to assess
causality at the level of the firm or industry than at sector or
national level.</p>

<p>Econometric studies in NZ employ industry net output or Solow
type measures of net productivity as the dependent variable.
Regressions are specified that include capital and labour (in the
first case) and measures of stocks of R &amp; D knowledge. The
latter are defined as depreciating assets that are added to by
expenditures on R &amp; D but also subtracted from as the ideas
lose relevance. It is common to separate stocks derived from public
funds and those generated by private funds. The scope of these
studies is limited by a lack of data on investment in R &amp; D at
the industry level. This is important as each higher level of
aggregation obscures the possible underlying responses to R &amp; D
carried out.</p>
<p>So far these studies have identified positive relationships
between net output (after a period) and private R &amp; D
investment in the total market sector and in agriculture,
processing, and services. For public R &amp; D investment there is
negative relationship for the total market sector and the
agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, and transport sectors.
Translated into rates of return on past investment in private R
&amp; D these results indicate returns on investment varying from
12 per cent (market sector) to 68 per cent (agriculture)(Johnson
1999).</p>

<p>Earlier studies have included a study by Scobie and Eveleens of
the agriculture sector where fairly clear records of research and
extension expenditure had been kept (Scobie&amp;Eveleens 1986).
This study related R &amp; D expenditure to a total productivity
ratio (gross return/total input) for the sector drawn from the work
of B.P. Philpott (1969). The Scobie and Eveleens study of
agricultural productivity from 1926 to 1984 used a model in which
the observed level of total productivity in agriculture in each
year was dependent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the weather conditions (as measured by an index of soil
moisture deficits) in the previous year;</li>
<li>the level of spending on extension services;</li>
<li>the number of graduates and diplomats trained in the
agricultural sciences (including horticulture, veterinary science,
food technology) over the past 15 years;</li>
<li>the economic conditions of the agricultural sector (as measured
by the annual deviation of net farm income from its long term
trend); and</li>
<li>the real spending on agricultural research in that year, and in
each of the preceding years (up to 30 years earlier).</li>
</ul>

<p>The results showed that, on average, research results are slowly
incorporated [in the case of livestock farming] into practice and
their impact on productivity increased reaching a peak after 11
years and finally tailing off after a total of 23 years. In terms
of research expenditure alone [i.e. holding other variables
constant], $1m of research expenditure generated total benefits of
$8.5m over the following 23 years, giving an internal rate of
return of 30 per cent.</p>
<h2>Cost-benefit Studies</h2>
<p>Table 7 shows the results of cost-benefit studies on a project
basis undertaken by FRST and HortResearch. While these may be
possibly <q>successful</q> projects, they have longer track records
that permit evaluation. The results are generally very favourable.
It is not clear to me whether the methodology is always the same in
each case study. There is a need to be clear about private returns
and social returns to investment and whether national income
conventions are being observed. The point of these results is that
they are concrete evidence of the national benefit from research
investment and that they do away with unwarranted criticism that
research does not pay off.</p>

<h2>Under-Investment in Agricultural R &amp; D</h2>
<p>In the years up to 1999, public good science effort was
categorised by <q>industry output areas</q>, defined as areas where
major beneficiaries were located. Total public good funding of
investment proposals was published in terms of these
classifications. Of the 19 <q>output areas</q>, four could be
clearly classified as <q>agricultural research</q>; namely animal
research, dairy research, forage and crops, and horticultural crops
research (Table 8). The extent of the subtle shift in funding over
the years from 1993 to 1999 by the contestable funding system can
be seen in the decline in agricultural research outputs' share of
public good funding from 46 per cent to 42 per cent, with only
dairy research actually bettering its share of resources. This data
was discontinued after 1999. It should be noted that the above
<q>output areas</q> do not exactly follow the same boundaries as
those of the research institutes, and also include private
providers and the universities (i.e. all sucessful applicants for
public funds in these categories).</p>

<p>The agricultural CRIs also received a diminishing share of the
the total public good funds made available through the contestable
bidding process (Table 9). In the long run, there has been a
gradual shift from public funding to private funding of CRIs. From
1993 to 2004, non-governmental funding rose from 37 percent of
total revenue to 54 per cent across all institutes (Johnson et al
2006). Of these total funds, the agricultural CRIs' share fell
slightly from 55 per cent to 52 per cent. Their share of public
good funds fell from 59 per cent to 50 percent, and as a result of
these two trends, agricultural public good funding fell from 37 per
cent of all funding to 23 per cent. This confirms the trends shown
up in the <q>output areas</q> analysis in Table 8.</p>

<p>This scenario is the result of the cumulative effect of FRST
administrative processes rather than a deliberate government policy
instruction. CRIs were instructed to find alternative sources of
income, administrators were told to involve the private sector to a
greater extent. Private sector assistance was expanded and funds
made available. <q>Agriculture</q> was suspect because it had
previously received the greatest public support for many years.
However, there is a lack of evidence to demonstrate whether the new
allocation of funds is a better outcome than it was was previously.
Reasons for the decline in agricultural shares of public investment
in R &amp; D include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a common belief that agriculture is an <q>old industry</q> and
support should be going to <q>new</q> industries;</li>

<li>the move from production output area goals to broader
goals;</li>
<li>constraints on public funding;</li>
<li>the movement away from public providers of appropriable
(profit-earning) research;</li>
<li>a shift away from output areas where public good funding was
<q>too dominant</q>:</li>
<li>the desire for <q>complementary</q> or supporting funding to
the private sector;</li>
<li>the <q>crowding out</q> belief held in some circles (government
activity taking over private sector roles); and</li>

<li>the possible over-application of <q>market failure</q> theory
(too much public support for areas of under-investment).</li>
</ul>
<p>The science reforms were carried out after the government
management reforms of the 1980s. Prior to the election of the
Labour Government in 1984, government policy for development had
been oriented around export industries. This owed its antecedents
to the 1963 Agricultural Development Conference which had focussed
on improving the national balance of payments deficit. After the
1985 devaluation and the floating of the exchange rate Finance
Minister Douglas had stated that exports no longer matter. Thus the
science reforms came in when the export imperative was no longer
operating and other reasons had to be sought for justifying higher
expenditure on public R &amp; D. Now MoRST (2006b) have published a
think piece by one of its staff that re-echoes the earlier export
paradigm. He concludes <cite><q>Primary sector outputs should be
seen not just as commodities but instead increasingly as the
sophisicated products of world quality R &amp; D. We should
emphasise productivity and added value to our existing comparative
advantages through strengthening and extending primary sector
innovation. Enormous potential remains to add more value and build
market demand for existing and new primary-sourced
products</q></cite>. Welcome aboard MoRST.</p>
<h2>New developments in funding policy</h2>
<p>The planning system had been criticised for getting its
priorities wrong, for lack of transparency and for the ucertainty
with regard to future support from public funds. Bidders for public
good funds complained about the short-term cycles of research
planning the contestable system encouraged. A scientist was quoted
as saying</p>

<p><cite><q>the key issue is uncertainty. Once you put in a funding
application you don't know for nine months whether or not you are
going to be successful. That makes it difficult to plan
ahead</q></cite>.</p>
<p>The research establishment was used to long planning horizons
under the old system and were able to divert resources to new areas
without upsetting staff security of tenure. Under the contestable
system, some well-established projects had to be curtailed and
specialist staff diverted to other projects. However, government
was slow to respond to requests to modify the contestable system of
allocating public resources.</p>
<p>The Association of Scientists expressed the view that there had
been inefficient management of Research Science and Technology
resources (Campbell, Lillis and Grieve, 2005).</p>
<p>Inefficient management leads to excessive transaction costs on
research institutions through the proliferation of funding
instruments, along with excessively expensive bidding processes and
reporting requirements, in tandem with excessive use of
contestability, over-prescription of research and inadequate
funding for excellence-based curiosity-driven research; lack of
clear strategic planning and transparent funding policy around key
research areas, thus reducing the ability of research organisations
to plan for the future and fund equipment adequately.</p>
<p>It became clear that there was a need to replace short term
contestable funding and move toward longer term commitment of
resources to individual research providers to plan their own
priorities. The agricultural research community in particular has
been increasingly vocal on the role it wished to play and critical
of the old contestable fund system.</p>
<p>The Minister for Research Science and Technology announced that
it was now time for less contestability and more annual <q>devolved
allocations</q> to CRIs. Research institutes needed sustainable
funding to be able to maintain core competencies, finance capital
works, new equipment and address the loss of researchers and
inability to recruit young scientists:.</p>
<p><cite><q>Contestability is not completely the wrong answer,
because it drives innovation, but it went to
extremes</q></cite>.</p>

<p>He noted that previously the aim of science policy had been to
reduce funding of research of benefit to industry from the public
purse, requiring industries and producers to contribute directly to
appropriate Crown research institute research programmes. He also
indicated it was time CRI boards were given more of the
discretionary roles they were set up for, instead of the funding
bodies making all the key decisions.</p>
<p>The Minister stated that the government would continue to
sustain strong investment in Research Science and Technology,
particularly on people and resources. The new Capability Fund will
replace the former Non-Science Outputs Fund (NSOF), to assist the
CRIs to maintain core capabilities.</p>
<p>In a later statement (Morst 2005), government confirmed that it
had moved away from the competitive bidding model for R &amp; D
funding toward more long term arrangements with the science
providers. Government needed to step up from simplistic public
choice theory models of the 1990s. The needs of the industry were:
long-term sustainable investment; a stable funding environment;
support for high performers; a clear and purposeful R &amp; D
agenda; enhanced opportunities for collaboration, networking and
technology transfer; and Research Science and Technology that is
valued, trusted and supported by New Zealanders.</p>
<p>The aim was to provide a clear understanding of critical
responsibilities of players in an Research Science and Technology
system with a focus on core capabilities that deliver benefit to
New Zealand so research organisations can manage better for their
people and future research priorities. Alongside the multi-year
budget package a one-off statement would be developed on the
obligations and expectations for sectors. A series of Research
Science and Technology directions or roadmaps for key science areas
would be developed with relevant groups of stakeholders, key users
and research organisations. There would be increased emphasis on
collaboration and networking (ibid).</p>
<p>This re-orientation of policy is reflected in FRST's statement
of intent dated April 2005 (FRST 2005a).</p> 
<p class=blocktext>
<i>To support the Government's strategies and address the Minister's challenges
FRST's strategy focuses on:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>investing in areas that will help achieve measurable
target outcomes where Research Science and Technology can make a
real difference in improving wealth and wellbeing;</i></li>
<li><i>investing in a manner that encourages improved
performance in achieving these outcomes including greater
devolution of decision making to Research Science and Technology
providers;</i></li>
<li><i>evaluating and bench marking performance to support
making the right investment choices to reinforce and reward good
performance;</i></li>
<li><i>enhancing the Foundation's role as facilitator of an
integrated and responsive innovation system'.</i></li>
</ul></p>

<p>In a document about investment signals and requests for
proposals on the website (FRST 2005b), the Foundation outlines how
it will handle investment proposals for the round starting in July
2007. FRST notes that the Minister wishes to bring greater
stability into the funding environment. This will involve reducing
contestability in the system by devolving funding and detailed
decision making to research organisations although some portfolios
funds will be released for investment through fully contestable
project rounds. FRST interprets this as investment that is narrower
and deeper.</p>
<p>In summary, the short term system of bidding rounds, project by
project, was to be superceded by a system of longer term block
grants that devolve project choice on the research providers.
Control passes back to the CRIs and other providers who will have
prepare their longer term strategies for FRST scrutiny. There does
not appear to be, as yet, a concomitant increase in the government
vote for Research Science and Technology, so the future directions
of research may well involve more of the same. Also, the future of
agricultural public research funding lies with the FRST and not
with the CRIs. As will be seen below, a fresh approach needs to be
developed that establishes the primacy of agricultural research and
the reasons for it.</p>

<h2>Dividing the Cake: A view on negotiated funding</h2>
<p>In an unpublished paper, Quigley (2006) compares the funding of the CRIs with that of the universities.</p>
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>Each year the New Zealand Government makes direct investments in scientific research of around $750 million. To ensure the best return to that investment of public
funds, the different allocation mechanisms rely to a considerable
extent on competitive bids for the available funds, and on rigorous
scientific assessment of those bids. Thus, the introduction of a
'negotiated investment pathway' by the Foundation for Research,
Science and Technology (FRST) represents a substantial change to
public policy for a substantial part of this investment in
scientific research. Negotiated investment will remove 30 percent
of funding from FRST contestable pools, and may remove as much as
50 percent of contestable funds in the medium term. The objective
of the policy change is to halt the reduction in the share of FRST
funding being allocated to Crown Research Institutes (CRIs).
Reflecting this objective, almost all FRST contracts eligible to
enter the negotiated pathway are with CRIs even though the value of
outstanding FRST contracts held by CRIs is only around 50 percent
of total investment.</q></cite></p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>The debate around this funding
change has been vigorous, but of greatest interest from the
perspective of science policy has been the clear articulation of
two views about why it is important to retain funding in CRIs.
First, it has been claimed that CRIs have an inherent disadvantage
in competing for funding against universities and private
institutions because they are less able to bear the risk associated
with contestable funding than institutions with more diversified
streams of revenue. Second, it has been claimed that CRIs maintain
critical national scientific capability in a way that universities
cannot, so that when CRI scientists do not obtain funding in
contestable funding pools, the social costs are greater than the
social benefits obtained from the investment in the alternative
university or private institution research team. This paper
considers both claims before considering alternative policy
responses that may be more efficient than negotiated
funding.</q></cite></p>
<p>Quigley believes that the CRIs have been slow to respond
to the new competitive science policy since the 1990s. They have
not adjusted their approach to sources of uncertainty which are
within the purview of management and thus may be managed by the
level of investment in relevant effort. He suggests they can be
managed through investment in insurance, and while there is no
formal insurance market available to mitigate the negative effects
of failure to receive funding from FRST, there are in practice many
insurance mechanisms available. The most obvious relevant insurance
mechanism is the submission of multiple co-operative bids, which
has the effect of allowing institutions to reduce the risk of
failing to receive funding at the cost of being required to share
funding for the bids that are successful.</p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>Another relevant insurance
mechanism is diversification within the individual institution,
which effectively reduces the impact on the institution as a whole
of failure to receive funding for any individual activity.
Technically, diversification is advantageous where uncertainty
associated with one income flow (such as FRST contracts) is
independent of uncertainty associated with income flows from other
sources (such as commercial contracts or teaching). This
diversification effect will provide universities with advantages
from having alternative streams of revenue, such as for teaching.
However, the suggestion that teaching revenue allows New Zealand
universities to fund a pool of surplus labour which is available to
compete for research funds and utilised only when it is successful
seems implausible given substantial real reductions in per-student
funding for teaching over the past decade.</q></cite></p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>Though CRIs have sources of
revenue other than FRST contracts, it might be argued that some
sorts of diversification by CRIs are not feasible, and that the
generation of funding streams from teaching students is one example
of a diversification strategy that is not open to CRIs. But
diversification does not need to be internal to the organisation,
and contracts to provide teaching services to universities and
polytechnics represent an obvious, and (given the strong synergies
between research and tertiary teaching) desirable avenue for the
diversification of CRIs.</q></cite></p>

<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>It is therefore unclear what
weight should be placed on the view that CRIs are disadvantaged in
their ability to bear random variations in outcomes in funding
rounds. Much of the variation in outcomes is endogenous, and thus
determined by investment in the bid. Where uncertainty is
exogenous, much of it falls within the realm of normal scientific
assessment of quality. Even the (likely small) purely random
component can be mitigated through insurance strategies such as
co-operative bidding and contracts that generate alternative
revenue streams.</q></cite></p>

<h2>Recent responses from the agricultural research community</h2>
<p>It is clear that agricultural research interests have made
their position known to successive Ministers in recent years. There
have been submissions from AgResearch, the major research
institute, and from Fonterra, the recently formed national dairy
cooperative. One key development has been the development of
Fonterra's strategic framework for dairy farming's future. The
purpose of the framework was to set the strategic direction for all
on-farm research, development, extension and education. Fonterra
needed to have a plan for increased efficiency that did not
compromise economic, environmental and animal welfare imperatives,
it was stated (Dairy Insight et al 2005).</p>
<p>The industry has set a goal of boosting farm productivity
by 4 per cent per year. The group has already lobbied Government
for a $60m boost to pastoral farming research . The Chairman of
Fonterra states that putting resources into <q>core</q> agriculture
is a safer bet than some less-established sectors, and that the
above sum is a relatively small amount of money given the potential
economic benefits to the country (The Dominion Post, 28.9.05). The
CEO stated that the company wanted a more efficient model that
makes sense for all parties involved. It wanted to avoid as much
duplication in the farming sector as possible and to ensure the
company was not burdened with spending money on research that does
not directly benefit its value- added goals.</p>

<p>AgResearch announced in November 2005, that it needed $73m
for buildings alone. Dr West argued that the extra $60m for the
dairy industry should go straight to the crown research institutes
who will then decide what to spend it on. He also argued that
farmers' contributions to research investment should rise
too:</p>
<p class='blocktext'><cite><q>The $10m they contribute in levies is
not much when you consider farm gate returns are $6
billion.</q></cite></p>
<p>AgResearch's strategic plan for the next 15 years was
based on the country investing in its core strengths, the husbandry
of plants and animals, he said.</p>
<p>Taken with Government showing a willingness to increase
devolved funding to the CRIs there is now a marked willingness in
the agricultural research sector to expand their research
activities over the static levels recorded above. The agricultural
research lobby has increased its public relations effort and has
started to put significant research programs in front of government
for public good spending. Private participation will be needed as
well. While the Minister talks of investing 3 per cent of GDP (a
trebling) in future years, marked increases in research spending by
the government or the private sector are likely to emerge more
slowly in terms of this measure.</p>
<h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
<p>The last 15 years in New Zealand has seen a significant
experiment undertaken with regard to the organisation of public R
&amp; D services. There has traditionally been a fairly even split
of resources between the government providers, private sector
providers and university providers. Before the 1990 reforms, some
commentators were of the view that the government sector was too
dominant and had been creating a <q>crowding-out</q> effect on the
private sector. The erstwhile aim of the reforms was to increase
private participation and to decrease the influence of the large
government departments and the funding drain on the government. To
this end, 10 research companies were set up to absorb the science
roles of all government departments. To finance the new structures,
the former departmental appropriations were placed in a government
pool known as the Public Good Science Fund (PGSF) for allocation to
all research providers on a bidding basis. Total science
appropriations include other administrative functions performed by
MoRST and a portion of the Education Vote that funds research in
the universities.</p>

<p>Since the reforms began, national spending on science has
kept pace with gross domestic product (GDP). In terms of provider
spending there has been an increase in the share of research being
performed by the private sector and the universities and a decline
in the share conducted by government agencies. In terms of overall
funding, there has been a parallel increase from the private sector
and a decline in the government share. These changes were
predicated by the reforms in the first place and could be said to
have achieved what the planners set out to do. It is not clear
whether this is a better outcome, apart from less drain on the
fisc.</p>
<p>Agricultural research before the reforms absorbed about
one third of all resources made available. Going by the spending by
the agricultural crown institutes (Ag Research, Crop &amp; Food
Research, HortResearch and Landcare) the share of CRI resources
going to agricultural research has almost been maintained (55 per
cent in 1993-94 and 52 per cent in 2004-05). At the same time, the
share of agricultural research funded by the government has fallen
from 59 per cent to 50 per cent.</p>
<p>There has been criticism of the funding mechanisms and the
rules which were used to choose successful projects. As a result,
the government issued in 2005 the outlines of a new system of
public good research funding which would be based on longer-term
contracts with the research providers and devolving more of the
individual project choice to them also. This development is a
return to the ways of the 1970s and 1980s when the two large
departments were in sole charge of spending priorities for the
public good science money.</p>
<p>There has been a resurgence in the agriculture research
sector since 2005. The major participants like AgResearch,
Fonterra, Dexcel and Dairy Insight have produced a series of
reports on future developments, particularly for the dairy sector,
which envisage both increased private spending and an increased
contribution from the government. The industry sees all the animal
and forage industries working together for the common good and with
an increased commitment from public funds.</p>
<p>It remains clear that the public purse is to be kept
tightly controlled for the immediate future and all the research
interests will have to either fund more research themselves or find
new sources of support. For the agricultural sector, the need is to
continue to present arguments based on the close relationship
between innovation and export growth. New Zealand remains dependent
on a few key internationally traded primary products which, because
of the distance from markets, have to be produced and shipped at
lower prices than other temperate agricultual exporters. This
indicates that priorities should reflect less social and blue skies
research and more sectoral and product oriented
research.</p>

<p>This administrative arrangement had first been suggested
by the 1988 Science and Technology Committee (STAC), though it was
not adopted until 1991 (Jardine 1989, p.11).</p>

<p>There is an explanatory memo on the MoRST website
<q>Benefit to New Zealand: Principles for Publicly Funded Research
Science and Technology</q> which spells out a broad definition of
the nature of the benefits expected. They comprise the total
economic, social and environmental benefits that accrue to NZ
residents from the creation and application of new knowledge
generated by Research Science and Technology. The public sector
should not subsidise Research Science and Technology that the
private sector or others would or should do anyway but it may add
to it. A comparision would be an investment company buying and
selling shares on the stockmarket where future earnings on company
shares are unknown or at least uncertain and a strategy has to be
in place for dealers to follow. It follows that good management
would require that the selection of high return but risky
investments is balanced by investments of lower return but lower
risk.</p>
<p>Output areas were categories used by the DSIR prior to the
reforms. They reflected earlier attempts to identify goals and
objectives for the science organisations by subject matter.
Currently statistical material is set out by socio-economic
objectives said to reflect the purpose of research (MoRST
2006).</p>
<p>A reviewer notes that in NZ a researcher can expect to be
successful with one in every twelve research proposals that he or
she submits. In the UK, it is one in every four proposals. Devine
(2003) observes that the persistent dissenting voice of the NZ
Association of Scientists and the Institute of Agricultural Science
contributed a more human face to the reforms.</p>
<p>Sustaining Strong Investment: Excellence in Knowledge and
Innovation(www.morst.govt.nz) Negotiated funding is limited to 30
percent of total funding in 2007 and 2008, but given the criteria
established to qualify for negotiated funding, FRST has indicated
that the proportion of funding in the negotiated pathway could rise
to 50 percent (Foundation for Research Science and Technology 2006a
Appendix 2).</p>
<p>Contracts eligible to enter the negotiated pathway must be
single contracts owned by one research organisation that terminate
on 30 June 2007, represent a continuous investment history of at
least six years and two contestable bidding rounds, involve funding
of more than $1 million per annum, and represent more than 7.5
percent of the portfolio to which they belong. Foundation for
Research Science and Technology 2006b: 45.</p>
<p>Government has responded to this initiative. On the FRST
website, there is a draft investment scope document inviting bids
for $7.8m of funds, sponsored by Dairy Insight, Fonterra and FRST,
to be devoted to on-farm productivity growth.</p>
