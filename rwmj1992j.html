<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>This paper takes a political economy view of the Earth Summit
and discusses the problems it attempted to solve and the solutions
it arrived at. The political economy approach is an attempt to
describe a general framework that encompasses both economic and
political phenomena. The testing of the framework lies in its
success in explaining the events under discussion. In this case the
Earth Summit is seen as a means to overcome the "free rider"
problem, in order to achieve objectives in the interests of all
countries.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In 1972, the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment
was held in Stockholm, representing the first major international
meeting on the environment. In 1983 the UN General Assembly
established the World Commission on the Environment and
Development, chaired by Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of
Norway, to examine the state of the environment and development in
the perspective of the year 2000 and beyond.</p>
<p>The report of the World Commission, Our Common Future, made it
clear that there are risks in current rates and patterns of
development, especially if replicated in developing countries. The
recommendations of the Commission led to a decision by the General
Assembly in December 1989 to hold a United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development in Brazil in June 1992. This became
known as the Earth Summit.</p>
<p>Expectations were raised. Environmentalists saw the Earth Summit
as the last great hope to save the planet from disaster. Developing
countries, on the other hand, saw UNCED as a chance to raise the
prominence of development on the international agenda and extract
more financial assistance and debt relief in return for addressing
environmental concerns of developed countries.</p>
<p>The Earth Summit was eventually held in Rio de Janeiro from June
3 to June 14 1992; many thousands of representatives and NGOs and
the media attended; President Bush and over 100 other heads of
state arrived and gave speeches; and finally everyone went home.
From the initial high expectations, what was actually achieved?</p>
<p>Does the political economy model offer any help in this process?
Many non-government organisations (NGOs) were consulted and
expected to take part. The New Zealand country statement was being
prepared as early as 1990 and went through several drafts as
treatment of many issues was novel and, in certain cases,
unacceptable to some. New Zealand had to ask what an individual
country, especially one of its size, could do to influence the
outcome?</p>
<h3>The political economy view</h3>
<p>The political economy model attempts to integrate economic
structures and processes with socio-political phenomena. Changes in
economic processes are linked to the structure and goals of the
various participants in the economy and the influence of external
power holders and dominant interest groups. In the context of an
international negotiation like the Earth Summit there is a conflict
between national policies and international policies, and between
the rich and the poor, in the realms of development economics and
environmental protection. The conflict raises questions about the
international distribution of national income and the sharing of
world natural resources. The resolution of conflict is sought in an
international negotiation and commitment to a new course of
action.</p>
<p>The model attempts to describe a more general theory of
behaviour than the normal profit maximising objectives of
entrepreneurs. It seeks to incorporate the behaviour of groups of
people into economic theory and places considerable emphasis on
full information and incentives to act in favour of the group
interest. It includes government both as politicians and as
bureaucrats; each seeking what is in their self interest as in
public choice theory. It seeks to explain by descriptive techniques
how policy outcomes are achieved and places considerable emphasis
on the distribution of power.</p>
<p>Economic models tend to regard Government as a passive partner
implementing recommendations which maximise social welfare subject
to the pursuit of some non-economic objectives. Political economy
models treat Government as endogenous, and policy emerges from the
interaction of rational policy makers and trade-sensitive economic
groups (Moore, 1990). The objective of intervention and the choice
of policy instruments are explained within the model. MacLaren
(1991) identifies two sub-models: one group is referred to as "the
social concerns," "social insurance" or "self-willed Government"
group, and the, other as "self-interest" or "clearing house
government" group. The first group is permeated with the idea of
social justice and the second by the idea of rational self-interest
of policy makers. Politicians are assumed to choose policies in
such a way as to maximise political support and re-election.</p>
<p>The two themes which best seem to suit the UNCED process are
those analysing group behaviour and national self-interest.
Individual nations enter the United Nations process with single and
equal votes but soon appear to belong to various groups or blocs.
Thus we have the G7, the G77, CANZ, North and South etc. In
addition, non-government groups (NGOs) were also invited to the
"summit" and were also consulted during the preparatory phase.
Another "group" is the loose amalgam of middle class intellectuals
who keep the conservation movement alive and growing mainly in
developed countries. Groups are thus collections of like minded
nations or people with common interests still pursuing their own
goals either in the group or independently. They belong to
MacLaren's social concern group.</p>
<p>National self-interest is the concern of the participating
nations. Nations have to protect their own interests in the
negotiations and form groups if they see advantage in it. In this
scenario, politicians and bureaucrats tend to become merged, though
not always, as disagreements within the US delegation demonstrated.
While politicians are seen as acting to maximise votes, bureaucrats
can be seen as a group who want jobs and sometimes power and
prestige. Bureaucrats in national governments would have different
interests than those with positions, or seeking positions, in the
United Nations organisations.</p>
<p>In terms of economic processes, the UNCED proposals raise costs
for some nations, or reduce their access to resources, and impose
taxes on others to help compensate the first group for what are
seen to be inherent disadvantages (except where exploitation was
the original reason for the disadvantage). In effect, income
distribution is the underlying problem and gets reflected in debate
about burden-sharing, protecting existing standards of living,
official development assistance, property rights, and tropical
forests etc.</p>
<h3>The preparatory process: great expectations</h3>
<p>Mr Maurice Strong, the secretary general of UNCED, visited
Wellington in November 1991. He described the meeting of world
leaders in Brazil as a chance to write a "Magna Carta for the
Earth" setting the agenda into the next century. He said the Earth
Summit must establish a whole new basis for relations between the
rich and poor, North and South, and make a concerted attack on
poverty as a central priority. This was seen as equally imperative
for environmental security as it was in terms of moral and
humanitarian endeavours. "We owe at least this much to future
generations, from whom we have borrowed a fragile planet called
Earth" (UN 1992b, MfE 1992).</p>
<p>On the question of future planning, the UNCED secretariat issued
a statement saying "There will have to be extraordinary cooperation
between Governments, NGOs, the private sector, the financial
community, and other constituencies, to put the decisions of the
Earth Summit into effect. The Rio Conference of 1992 will shape our
collective future - and this will require an unprecedented effort
on the part of the global community to translate its results into
reality. While the Earth Summit will constitute a test of nations'
willingness to institute fundamental changes in economic behaviour,
the challenges ahead will be perhaps far more daunting. Change is
seldom easy" (UN 1992b).</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly established a Preparatory Committee
(Prepcom) open to all member nations. Prepcom met in Kenya in
August 1990, in Geneva in March 1991, in Geneva in August 1991, and
in New York in March 1992 (Prepcom IV). In terms of General
Assembly Resolution 44/228, Prepcom was responsible for drafting
the two centrepieces of the summit, the Earth Charter and Agenda 21
(UN 1992b). Prepcom was also responsible for negotiating a binding
convention on forest principles.</p>
<p>The Earth Charter was to be a declaration of basic principles
for the conduct of nations and peoples in respect of environment
and development to ensure the future "viability and integrity of
the Earth as a hospitable home for human and other forms of life"
(UN 1992b). Agenda 21 is a programme of action for the period
beyond 1992, citing issues to be addressed with "priorities,
targets, cost estimates, modalities and assignment of
responsibilities" (UN 1992b). The Conference was expected to
discuss the means of implementing the agenda through new and
additional financial resources, transfer of technology, and
strengthening of institutional capacities and processes.</p>
<p>The Rio Conference was also expected to discuss and agree to
binding conventions on specific areas of environmental concerns,
namely climate change and biological diversity. These were the
subject of separate parallel negotiations by governments, and were
to be ready for signing at Rio.</p>
<p>Climate Change: In 1988 the General Assembly adopted a
resolution recognizing climate change as a common concern. The UN
Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN World Meteorological
Organisation (WMO) then set up the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) to investigate the potential severity and
impact of global climate change and to suggest possible policy
responses. In December 1990 the General Assembly set up the
Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention
on Climate Change (INC) supported by UNEP and WMO. Negotiations
were to run parallel to the PrepCom process with the aim of
producing a convention ready for signing by Governments at the
Conference.</p>
<p>IPCC had noted in a report to the General Assembly in 1989 that
existing legal instruments and institutions were insufficient and a
frame work convention was desirable. Such a convention could
produce specific targets and quantitative reductions that would be
added as protocols to the original convention (UN 1992a).</p>
<p>Biological Diversity: UNEP first called on Governments to
consider an international legal instrument for the conservation and
rational use of biological diversity in 1987. UNEP then established
an Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity, which
held three sessions between November 1988 and July 1990. On the
basis of the group's final report UNEP established a Working Group
of Legal and Technical Experts to negotiate the convention, later
becoming the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a
convention on Biological Diversity (INC). The latter group met in
Madrid in June 1991 and held its concluding session in Nairobi in
May 1992 (UN 1992a).</p>
<p>The convention is meant to recognise the essential role of
biological diversity in maintaining the life-sustaining systems of
the biosphere, the significant reductions in biodiversity that are
occurring as a result of human activities, and the urgent need to
prevent and attack the causes of species and ecosystem loss at
their source. It was hoped the convention would provide a mandate
for integrating conservation and development objectives in
government planning, and a mechanism for funding projects that
combine the two in practice (WWF 1992). This raised a number of
issues concerning the provision of financial aid to enable
developing countries to implement the terms of the convention,
questions of access to genetic materials and the sharing of profits
from their future development, the use of new technologies in
tropical forests, and the ownership and use of patent rights in the
latter area (UN 1992a)</p>
<p>Forest Principles: Prior to the establishment of UNCED, the Food
and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) had initiated consultations on a
possible international legal agreement on conservation of forests.
Under UNCED, some parties sought an agreement that would ban the
cutting of tropical rainforests. Developing countries responded by
seeking to extend any agreement to include consideration of forests
in temperate and boreal (northern) latitudes, where much of the
forest had been cleared long ago, and hence was not such an issue.
As a result of this broad disagreement, PrepCom proposed a set of
principles for the sustainable management of global forests as a
basis for post-Summit negotiations on an international legal
agreement on forestry.</p>
<p>Thus the emphasis was to be on global management of forests
without highlighting any particular countries or forest type. There
was a need to recognise individuals countries sovereignty in such
matters and there was seen to be a need for policies that redressed
the external indebtedness of developing countries which depend on
exploitation of their forest resources. The question was raised
whether the cost of such programmes should be shared by the
international community (UN 1992a).</p>
<h3>The outcomes of the Earth Summit: failed expectations?</h3>
<p>The Earth Charter, Agenda 21, and the three conventions were to
be the foundation for addressing the world's ills. Some saw them as
an environmental blueprint, a grand design. One New Zealand
commentator said that UNCED would be for the environment what GATT
is to trade, suggesting a set of binding rules or perhaps even
uniform international standards. Even by Prepcom IV, in New York in
February 1992, it was clear these high expectations would not and
could not be met. Indeed, it is doubtful that the General Assembly
ever envisaged such an outcome, but that did not prevent interested
groups from stating their own expectations for UNCED.</p>
<h6>The Rio Declaration</h6>
<p>The Earth Charter was re-named the Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development, and the vision of a "Magna Carta" was
gone. PrepCom IV agreed to re-affmn the Stockholm Declaration, and
call for a continued global partnership for sustainable
development. The new Rio Declaration includes phraseology which can
only be appreciated by repeating some of it here:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"States have the sovereign right to exploit
their own resources...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Development must occur on a sustainable
basis...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Eradicating poverty and reducing disparities
in standards of living are indispensable.... "</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Developing countries shall be given special
priority...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Developed countries should acknowledge the
responsibilities they bear...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Countries should pursue appropriate
demographic policies...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Trade policy measures for environmental
purposes should not constitute a disguised restriction on
international trade...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"States should promote the internalisation of
environmental costs...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"The polluter should in principle bear the
cost of pollution...."</p>
<p>These are but a sample from a statement with a preamble and 27
principles. The Declaration was largely completed at PrepCom IV but
was subject to modification at Rio. Though the declaration is not
legally binding, it is nevertheless aimed at giving Governments a
strong moral commitment to adhere to its principles. However, once
a consensus among all countries was reached, it seems the
Declaration contains few principles that most governments would not
already claim to be adhering to.</p>
<p>(2) As final texts have still not arrived from the United
Nations at time of writing, the precise wording given here is not
authoritative.</p>
<h3>Agenda 21</h3>
<p>By Prepcom IV, Agenda 21 had developed into a massive exercise
in bureaucratic planning, describing literally hundreds of things
that governments, international organisations, and NGOs "should do"
to integrate the environment and development. The sheer volume of
detail swamped any element of moral force, and required that
Governments could only be expected to pick and choose those
activities that were relevant and of high priority for their own
circumstances.</p>
<p>Agenda 21 sets out, among other things, the financial and
technical means by which specific action programmes are to be
carried out. In particular this will mean identifying more
effective help for developing countries to play their full part in
meeting global challenges, while continuing their development in a
environmentally sustainable way.</p>
<p>Agenda 21 is divided into four main sections:<br />
I Social and Economic Dimensions;<br />
II Conservation and Management of Resources for Development;<br />
III Strengthening the Role of Major Groups IV Means of
Implementation</p>
<p>The Chapter titles of sections I and II are given in Table

<p>Again the detail of this document prevents a full appreciation
of its contents. Within Chapter 14 on sustainable agriculture there
are 11 programme areas, such as "Land Resources Planning far
Agriculture," and within each programme a number of components, as
shown in Table 2. New Zealand's national interests in this chapter,
as distinct from the collective global interest, principally lie in
Programme A, dealing with agricultural policy.</p>

<p>New Zealand recognised that some of the relevant clauses could
be interpreted in a way prejudicial to our interests. Our delegates
were asked to ensure that the documents recognised the importance
of trade liberalisation for alleviating poverty in poor countries,
and that food security was defined as access to and ability to
acquire food, rather than self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>At New Yark in March 1992, the New Zealand delegation
successfully amended one phrase which encouraged government
subsidies of agriculture, only to find the phrase still there when
the results of Prepcom IV were circulated several weeks later.
After many hours of work in the labyrinth of offices that was the
UNCED Secretariat at Rio, and networking with sympathetic
delegations, the NZ delegation succeeding in correcting the error.
Such interventions illustrate how individual countries attempt to
modify the wording in these international documents so that they do
not come home to roost later!</p>
<p>Much of the rhetoric in Agenda 21 was familiar from FAO
documents of recent years. What was new, perhaps, was the greater
emphasis on environmental issues and the incorporation of these
into a debate on development resources. The UN and FAO had visited
most of the North-South issues previously and analysed the funding
problems many times. What is new is the political rhetoric that
goes with a large international meeting and the opportunity it
provides to shift national positions, even if such shifts are
slight.</p>
<h6>Climate Change</h6>
<p>The aim of this convention was to outline a set of general
principles and obligations for international cooperation.
Subsequent negotiations were to produce specific targets and
quantitative restrictions on greenhouse gases, though this was
contentious from the start. Before Rio, negotiations had already
moved into detail of specific actions required, but disagreement on
these issues had not been resolved.</p>
<p>The primary dispute concerned the setting of specific targets
and timetables for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, the
leading greenhouse gas. Some countries supported a proposal to
stabilise emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Others
(primarily the United States) wanted voluntary adherence to this
goal on the grounds that there was insufficient scientific evidence
on climate change to warrant such strong action. In the end, the
non-binding language was adopted to get all major nations to sign
the convention.</p>
<p>Agreement also had to be reached on the control of emissions of
other greenhouse gases, financial aid to developing countries;
conditions to be attached to any such aid; payments to developing
countries whose forests serve as global carbon "sinks"; and the
terms by which environmentally sound technologies were to be made
available to developing countries. (United Nations 1992a)</p>
<p>The framework convention itself is full of resounding
phraseology and generalities. Interspersed in the text, however,
are phrases with a heavier moral tone, eg:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Greenhouse gas emissions have come primarily
from developed countries, and these countries have the main
responsibility for combating climate change.... "</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Developing country compliance with the
convention will be dependent upon the effective implementation of
the provisions on financial resources and technology
transfer...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Developed countries should ensure efficient
cooperation in technology transfer and technologies and know-how to
developing countries on concessional, preferential and most
favourable terms...."</p>

<p>Finally there was debate on, among other things, whether a new
fund should be established under the convention or whether
assistance for developing countries should be drawn from existing
Official Development Assistance (ODA) funding arrangements. Along
with this was the related issue of the right of donors to attach
conditions to such aid.</p>
<h6>Biological Diversity</h6>
<p>The aim of the convention on biological diversity was to address
plant and animal extinction worldwide. The biodiversity debate
included a major focus on development, dealing with the maintenance
of the world's stock of genetic resources for future use and
development.</p>
<p>As with climate change, the debate on the convention was highly
controversial, and many believed that the original intentions had
been severely watered down by the time the draft convention reached
Rio.</p>
<p>Again, liberal quotation helps to appreciate the sense of the
convention (although precise wording is not confirmed pending receipt of final
documents):</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"States have the authority to determine access
to their genetic resources but should facilitate access to genetic
resources for environmentally sound uses on mutually agreed
terms...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"The countries benefiting most from
biodiversity carry the main responsibility for the cost of its
conservation...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"States should adopt measures for the recovery
and rehabilitation of endangered species and for their
reintroduction into their native habitats...."</p>
<p>Again, there are clauses which give special preferences to
developing countries and recognition to disadvantaged groups:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Conservation of biodiversity and the
sustainable use of biological resources require special funding for
developing countries...."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Practices and innovations developed by
indigenous peoples which contribute to the sustainable use of
biological resources and conservation of biodiversity should be
recognised and rewarded...."</p>
<p>In the end, the United States objected to this kind of
terminology and refused to sign. The US saw the convention as an
open-ended commitment to share technology with developing
countries, and providing insufficient protection to the interests
of the US biotechnology industry. Other issues concern, again, the
establishment of a new funding facility, that intellectual property
rights could be threatened by the transfer of environmental
technology to developing countries, and that vast profits are made
from genetic material originating in the third world (WWF
1992).</p>

<h6>Forest Principles</h6>
<p>Several weeks before the Summit convened in Rio, it was clear
that no consensus could be reached on a binding convention on
protection of the world's forests. The aim of developed countries
was to contain the cutting of tropical rain forests. Developing
countries had responded by suggesting that the principles cover
"all" forest situations. Again there were some statements which
could be agreed upon and some that could not. The following
statements were accepted:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"States have the sovereign and inalienable
right to utilize, manage, and develop their forests in accordance
with their development needs... on the basis of national policies
consistent with sustainable development ... on a sustainable basis,
including the conversion of such areas for other uses ... based on
rational land-use policies."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"National forest policies should recognise and
duly support the identity, culture, and rights of indigenous
people, their communities and other communities and forest
dwellers."</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Specific financial resources should be
provided to developing countries with significant forest areas
which establish programmes for the conservation of forests
including protected natural forest areas."</p>
<p>In the following paragraph, the words in italics were added at
Rio before the final agreement:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"Access to biological resources, including
genetic material, shall be with due regard to the sovereign rights
of the countries where the forests are located and to the sharing
on <i>mutually agreed terms</i> of technology and profits from
biotechnology products that are derived from these resources."</p>
<p>This amendment was made to reflect agreement on a contentious
chapter of Agenda 21 dealing with terms for transfer of technology,
and indicates the interrelationships between the different
documents.</p>
<p>As with biodiversity, forestry has all the elements of the
North-South debate of the last decade, focused all the more
strongly because of the middle class reaction in the developed
countries to further felling of tropical forest in Malaysia and
Brazil.</p>
<h6>Financial Resources</h6>
<p>The secretary-general of the conference had estimated that the
total foreign aid transfer implied by Agenda 21 was of the order of
$US 125 billion per year (Garran 1992). This would be the level of
assistance if donor countries increased their development
assistance to an average of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product,
as compared with current levels of 0.35 per cent. Implicit in the
move to this increased level of aid would be the establishment of
several new funding mechanisms to meet such a target as well as
existing mechanisms, such as the Global Environment Facility, the
UN's International Development Association, Regional Development
Banks, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p>
<p>The conference produced agreement on a text that committed
developed nations to more official development assistance
(ODA):</p>
<p class='blocktext'>"...countries reaffirm the UN target of 0.7
per cent of GDP for ODA, and agree to augment their programmes in
order to reach the target...some countries agreed to reach the
target by the year 2000...the Commission on Sustainable Development
will review and monitor progress...."</p>
<p>Precise wording is unconfirmed pending receipt of final
documents.</p>
<p>This implied support for a new Commission on Sustainable
Development, which had been contentious. The secretary general
announced donor pledges worth $US6-7 billion (NY Times 1992) though
some doubt was expressed whether this was new money.</p>
<h3>The political economy of UNCED: what happened?</h3>
<p>To understand what happened to the grand designs of the
originators and sponsors of the Earth Summit, one needs to consider
the nature of multilateral negotiations and the pressures on the
key players.</p>
<p>The "Earth Charter" ended up as the Rio Declaration because of a
fundamental difference between North and South. The South wanted a
statement that laid the responsibility for environmental
degradation, and especially global warming, squarely at the feet of
the rich nations of the North. Further, they wanted recognition
that they had a right to develop their own resources, that the
North had an obligation to provide assistance, and if the North
wanted the environment to be protected more than it had been during
the development of the North's economies, it would have to provide
even more aid and live up to previous commitments.</p>
<p>While the North would accept some responsibility for
environmental problems, it would not accept it all, and similarly
rejected the strong moralistic wording suggested by developing
countries. Many would have preferred stronger language on the
duties of nations to protect the environment, and the problems of
population growth, but the South was equally unwilling to accept
moral directions from the North. The only solution was to adopt a
Declaration largely filled with platitudes. Financial issues are
discussed further below.</p>
<p>Agenda 21 fell victim to a different set of pressures. Those who
envisaged a volume of environmental standards to be applied in
every country clearly never had a chance. Protecting the
environment for future generations is a luxury affordable only to
those who do not have to worry about how they will survive until
the next harvest. Not even developed country governments were
willing to cede sovereignty on the broad range of environmental
issues in Agenda 21, which were of tremendous political
significance to their voters, especially when it was impossible to
achieve the degree of protection in the South which Northern voters
wanted.</p>
<p>Thus, Agenda 21 became a long list of projects to integrate
development and environmental policies, many of the projects pulled
out of the files by UN and FAO officials for whom these projects
are bread, butter, and jam. It is easy to become cynical, let alone
bored, reading page after page of activities to be undertaken by
governments, drawing upon the expertise of these same officials and
their co-workers, adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars per
year.</p>
<p>Proponents of a strong climate change convention had to accept a
much weaker version to get President Bush to sign. Facing a
difficult re-election campaign, President Bush refused to support
any commitments which could potentially hinder the recovery of the
sluggish US economy. He suggested that limits on carbon dioxide
emissions might have done precisely that, though it is hard to
imagine how it could have impacted the American economy before the
election in November 1992. The political economy model would
suggest that Mr Bush perceived that, on balance, signing a
convention with fixed targets would have cost him votes.</p>
<p>The biodiversity convention ran into the same obstacle, only
this time the United States was completely isolated. The US claimed
the convention jeopardised future growth, because industry had
insufficient protection for the profits from new technology, but
neither developing countries nor other developed countries shared
this concern. The treaty was signed by 153 governments at Rio, but
not the United States.</p>
<p>The negotiations on forests encountered similar difficulties,
but now it was the developing countries which dug in their heels.
For Malaysia and Indonesia, in particular, forestry is a major part
of their economies, which they were not prepared to sacrifice in
order to accommodate residents of wealthy countries where the
forests had already been cleared. While Malaysia was the most
vocal, one suspects many developing countries were sympathetic.</p>
<h3>Overcoming the free rider problem</h3>
<p>Given these entrenched interests, one might question the value
of holding an international conference at all. This would overlook
the visibility and pressure that such a conference can bring to
bear on the issues, however. It is perhaps a tautology to say that
multilateral conventions deal with global issues, but this was
never more true than at UNCED. All governments and all peoples have
a genuine interest in seeing the world make progress on resolving
these issues, but they equally have an interest in bearing as
little of the cost as possible. This is the classic free-rider
problem so common in public sector economics.</p>
<p>By holding a high-profile summit, increased pressure can be
brought to bear on those holding out and refusing to "pay their
fair share." Prior to meeting in Rio, some governments expressed
concern that the Earth Summit would become a "pledging conference"
where world leaders would be expected to step to the podium and
announce their country's contribution. In fact, this must be
precisely what the organisers envisaged, for such dynamics are
essential to overcome the free-rider problem. This was true for the
binding conventions as well as for the issue of extra financial
resources.</p>
<p>But for the dynamics to work, the organisers wanted President
Bush to attend. Without him, the conference might have lacked the
necessary visibility, and other countries would have felt less
compelled to make financial contributions or cede sovereignty over
certain policies if the United States would not do the same. Mr
Bush realised that he was better off staying home than going to Rio
to be criticised for refusing to sign anything or make any
financial contribution. It was clear that those who did not measure
up would be treated with scorn and painted as villains, at least
for the duration of the conference.</p>
<p>Mr Bush agreed to attend the Summit when the mandatory targets
were removed from the climate change convention, clearing the way
for him to sign it. A few days before the Conference opened in Rio,
he announced a forest initiative with the aim of "halting the loss
of the world's forests by the end of the decade" (White House 1992).
The US asked other nations to join in doubling financial assistance
for forest protection. This was clearly intended to head off
criticism that the US was not doing its part. But the US$150
million pledged by Mr Bush as a "down payment" failed to impress
most observers.</p>
<p>And so no one got what they really wanted. President Bush
attended, but was vilified all the same. Meanwhile, few commitments
to new and additional financial assistance were made by
governments.</p>
<h3>Achievements</h3>
In the end, 153 heads of state, or their representatives, signed
the two treaties, one on global warming and the other on
biodiversity. These must still be ratified by a minimum number of
governments before coming into force. Delegates approved by
consensus three non-binding documents: the statement on Forest
Principles, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and
Agenda 21.
<p>The treaty on biodiversity must be considered a success, and the
Climate Change convention a limited success. The statement of
forest principles is of more dubious value, unless negotiations
continue to carry them into a binding convention. New Zealand,
however, saw progress in the statement's recognition of the role
that planted forests can play in meeting the world's need for
timber products.</p>
<p>The Commission on Sustainable Development may prove a useful
watchdog and brow-beater, if it can decide how to effectively
monitor the implementation of a plan so unwieldy as Agenda 21.
Otherwise it runs the risk of becoming another UN bureaucracy
buried in paperwork.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>The political economy model could certainly be developed further
to describe the behaviour of the participants at the conference, in
particular the common interests that led to bloc behaviour. The
conference itself showed the political process working to finer and
finer levels of decision making. Although a parallel conference was
organised for NGOs, it appears that by reason of distance and then
of urgency, the NGOs were largely shut out of the final decision
making. In the end, it is governments which must negotiate the
wording of documents they are asked to sign on behalf of their
citizens.</p>
<p>But the common interest groups of nations remained paramount in
the United Nations process, helped no doubt by procedures
developed over many years. By and large, the issues at Rio were the
same ones that dominated the international agenda for the past two
or three decades, and the voting blocs that have developed over
that time remained at the centre of the action. One development
worth noting is the increasing prominence of the Pacific Island
states on the issue of climate change.</p>
<p>The final documentation reflects what could be agreed at the
lowest common denominator level between the developed nations or
high standard of living nations and the less developed nations with
a lower standard of living.</p>
<p>In the end, the Earth Summit was mostly about the environment,
not about development, because the public in developed countries is
interested in, and at least somewhat willing to pay for, action on
the environment. Development aid is probably less popular than
ever; witness the "America First" theme in the US presidential
primary elections.</p>
<p>The Earth Summit had its successes. Many, however, will say that
it was too little, too late. The challenge for those seeking action
will be to channel the outcomes of Rio into concrete action by
member states. On some issues, efforts will be best focussed at
local and national governments, especially given the difficulty of
negotiating international agreement, which the Earth Summit made
all too clear. However, on truly global issues such as climate
change, it will be necessary to continue building international
consensus on action needed to solve the environmental problems of
the planet Earth.</p>
