This paper, delivered at the annual conference of the NZ Agricultural Economics
Society in July 2004, concerns trade impacts of recent policy
issues on the destination of NZ trade in meat products (beef and
veal, lamb and mutton). The countries concerned are Australia,
Canada, China, Germany, France, Japan, Korea, UK, and US. Policy
issues include tariff rate quotas in some markets and food safety
regulations. Results indicate both high and low price and income
elasticities in different markets according to their size and
maturity. Both quota and food safety are significant explanatory
variables.</li>

Regulations on the New Zealand Meat Trade'</a>, 
by K Cao and R Johnson. This paper was accepted for 
publication on the University of Melbourne AgriFood 
<a href="http://www.agrifood.info/review/2006/Cao_Johnson.html">website</a>
on 10 April 2006. The paper outlines how gravity models can be
employed to analyse trade in New Zealand meat to nine different
destinations for the period 1994-2003. The driving forces on the
economic side are incomes in importing countries and prices
received in New Zealand terms. Quota restrictions impede growth in
some markets but hygiene regulations are seen as a positive force
in encouraging trade in sheepmeat.</li>
