<h1>Is There Life After Subsidies?</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="abstract">In general, the economic progress of the
livestock/feed economy in New Zealand cannot be separated from
trends in the rest of the economy. This is particularly so in terms
of policies for the control of inflation and costs, policies for
import protection and tariffs and policies for the adjustment of
the exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar. The more detailed
description of agricultural/livestock policies must be viewed
against this macro-policy background.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>


<p>The nature of agricultural policies in New Zealand in recent years has come in for a good bit of flak from
more market and efficiency-oriented commentators recently. A recent
book in the subject is engagingly entitled "Farming Without Subsidies" (Sandrey and Reynolds, 1990) (S &amp; R hereafter) although most of the
discussions and conclusions are about macro-economic policy. This
paper is thus concerned with this relationship between macro and
micro economic policy and the guidance such an analysis provides
for future policy direction.</p>

<p>In the post-war period, the economy went
through a series of balance of payments crises which usually ended
up in a tightening of import restrictions and availability of
foreign exchange. The export sector was totally dominated by
agricultural exports and foreign exchange earnings fluctuated with
variations in world commodity demand. Imports of capital and
consumer goods were rationed by both quantitative import
restrictions and the availability of foreign exchange. Internal
trade cycles were set in motion by changes in export earnings which
lead to delayed</p>

<p class="F100 c28">responses in import demand often well after the
means of paying for increased imports had disappeared. Adherence to
fIxed exchange rate policies meant that there were no compensating
rationing devices for foreign exchange and indeed the Reserve Bank
sold and controlled all foreign exchange dealing within New
Zealand. A good summary of these problems and the attitud~s of the
period can be found in the report of the World Bank on New Zealand
in 1968 (World Bank, 1968), and further analysis by the Centre for
Agricultural Policy Studies, Massey University (Maughan, 1978).</p>


<p>In the 1960s the policy response to this
situation was to focus on greater growth of exports and to broaden
the export base. A number of incentive policies for agriculture
date from the Agricultural Development Conference of 1963 and a
broader approach to manufacturing exports dates from an Industrial
Development Conference in 1961 (S &amp; R, p.65). Policy advisors apparently were unsuccessful or
unable to get changes made in the foreign exchange mechanisms at
the time, although successive Governments felt quite able to make
unilateral shifts in the value of the New Zealand dollar when it
suited them.</p>

<p>In the 1970s there was an acceleration of the
degree of assistance to agriculture as growth prospects faltered
from time to time and additional costs accumulated, especially
after the oil crisis in 1974. Policies for agriculture in the 1970s
were justifIed on investment arguments related to growth and
security of incomes rather than in terms of compensatory
assistance. With the advent of SMPs in 1978, it was more clearly
recognised that the policy was a one-sided devaluation of the New
Zealand dollar, although for the first few years, the settings used
had little impact on farm gate prices.</p>

<p>In 1979, a more realistic approach emerged with
the Government agreeing to pegging the exchange rate to an index of
foreign price relativities. A small devaluation was used to launch
the new policy and the Reserve Bank adjusted the rate on a weekly
basis and derived the consequential cross-rates. This policy lasted
until 1982 when a wage and price freeze was instituted to tackle
the inbuilt inflationary trends which resulted from a continuously
devaluing currency, among other things. Clearly, when internal
prices were rising faster than foreign prices, the price relativity
indicator kept forcing the value of the New Zealand dollar down and
if the factors causing internal inflation were not properly
understood and controlled, then the pegged exchange rate policy was
also unsustainable.</p>

<h3>Protectionism</h3>

<p>Dual policies of industrial development date
from the election of the fIrst Labour Government in 1936.
DiversifIcation of the then agricultural economy was to be achieved
by the development of local processing and assembly plants behind a
barrier of import protection. It was inherent in this policy that
costs to the exporting sector would rise substantially. Federated
Farmers fought the issue for many years and were particularly
vociferous on the local assembly of radios and televisions, not to
mention farm machinery, gumboots and transport prices. The
Australian paradigm that the export sector should be compensated in
some way for these cost excesses was not commonly discussed in the
New Zealand policy framework. The extra cost to society was
understood well enough but the political support for a
fully-employed welfare oriented economy plus the recurrent balance
of payments crises prevented any realistic development of
alternative policy until the late 1970s. Certainly in the 1960s,
the National Development Conference and the Government rejected a
remit to transfer emphasis from quantitative restrictions to a
tariff basis.</p>

<p>The compensation paradigm was introduced into
the discussion in the early 1980s when detailed research work on
rates of protection started to reveal the extent of assistance to
both agriculture and manufacturing. It was also this work which
clarifIed that assistance tended to be uneven in its application
and some industries and products received much more than others.
The main argument for agricultural assistance in the 1960s and
1970s was export-led growth including stability of incomes, steady
investment and prospects of the pay-back.</p>


<p>It can be recognised that this policy approach
to agriculture was a second-best option, but even this has to be
qualifIed by the immense reluctance of Government to consider what
economists thought was fIrst-best, namely the removal of all
physical import restrictions and the progressive reduction of
tariffs down to almost zero. I believe that the period was more
characterised by compensation for an over-valued exchange rate than
for tariff compensation (S &amp; R, p.17)</p>

<h3>Terms of Trade</h3>


<p>Professor Raynor raises but does not discuss
the policy framework with regard to the international terms of
trade for agriculture. He says of the 1970s that agriculture became
the target of extensive production-promoting assistance,
effectively obscuring both the declining terms of trade for
agriculture and the rising real interest rates around the globe (S
 &amp;   R, p.1). Most policy
makers at the time were well aware of the commodity terms of trade
and its trends. Tl:te question which was always raised was what are
the alternatives. Perhaps New Zealand policy advisors had too much
faith in the theory of comparative advantage for their own good,
but the policy decision always was to go on doing what we were good
at. The fundamental decision to diversify the export base was taken
in the early 1960s and this bore good fruit in later
years. </p>

<p>The additions to the producer board
stabilisation schemes in the mid 1970s can also be viewed in this
light (S &amp;   R, Ch 5).   It was recognised that
commodity prices had been through several cycles in the post-war
period and in some cases the return to normality was always at a
lower point in real terms. Nevertheless, it was thought worthwhile
to institute schemes of buffer stocks and funds for all the main
commodities on the basis that Reserve Bank borrowings and
accumulated funds could eventually be paid back. Given earlier
problems with the stabilisation funds, not to mention overseas
commodity schemes like tin and coffee, it would probably have been
better to have paid everything out to the producers and encouraged
them to make the necessary savings. However, the Treasury attitude
to the Income Equalisation Scheme and private saving was always
very half-hearted and the necessary encouragement for individual
management of risk and savings has been long delayed, or
inadequately researched. Beside great political support for
producer boards and stabilisation, there is also great farmer
belief and faith in the collective arrangements we have for
agricultural marketing in New Zealand, and hence some of the
collective savings schemes have not been jettisoned to this
day. </p>

<p>The analysis of the effects of assistance for
agriculture also tends to emphasise the negative effects rather
than the positive effects (S &amp; R, p.166). An econometric model of the pastoral sector is
used to estimate production out-turns under with and without
assistance scenarios. It is concluded that livestock numbers would
have fallen only marginally while cattle numbers would have risen
at the expense of sheep. There is thus a hidden cost of assistance
in terms of the value of beef production foregone. This conclusion
rests on the assumption that the analyst knows what the long-term
trend in commodity prices would be. When one is framing policy one
does not have </p>

<hr />

<p class="center">5</p>


<p>this advantage. Other econometric models for
the same period show greater positive responses at the export
level, though the trends are the same (Johnson, 1986, pp.32-34). </p>


<h3>Performance</h3>


<p>At the end of the day, it is the performance of
the agricultural sector which counts the most. Performance will be
measured by the real contribution of agriculture to growth of GDP,
whether by exporting or local production. Given the surplus for
export, the fundamental conditions for continued agricultural
production and expansion will be the international competitiveness
of the sector. I fmd the discussion of this topic in S &amp;   R welcome (see pp. 2, 51-52,
279-286), though there appear to be inconsistencies in their
presentation (on p.2 an appreciation of the real exchange rate is
measured by an increase in the index, while on p.52 and on p.282 it
is measured by a decrease in the index!) </p>

<p>Remember that the real exchange rate is a price
index measuring the ratio of foreign prices (in this case the CPI)
to local domestic prices. The ratio can therefore be affected by
changes in foreign consumer prices, changes in the nominal exchange
rate and changes in local prices (inflation rate). Let us look at S
&amp;   R's index for the period
1965-1989 (see Graph I). This index is like the terms of trade; a
fall in the index makes a country worse off and vice
versa. </p>

<p >It is clear the mix of policies since 1965 has
maintained the real exchange rate at a roughly constant level for
the last 25 years. Remember that nominal exchange rates were fixed
or pegged up to 1982, but discrete adjustments were made from time
to time. It is then clear that internal costs were influential in
the middle 1970s in lowering the real exchange rate and hence
reducing the competitiveness of the country in this period. In 1976
foreign prices rose, helped by a devaluation in 1975. A period of
stability then followed until the election devaluation of 1984, and
competitiveness was artificially increased.</p>

<p>Since 1984, the nominal exchange rate has
become the dominating influence; as the dollar was floated and the TWI has been maintained by monetary
policies, there has been a steady appreciation in the real exchange
rate since 1984, and the country's competitiveness has declined. In
1988/89 some relaxation of monetary policy enabled a small
depreciation of the nominal rate to take place and with a lower
rate of inflation the </p>

<hr />

<p class="center">6</p>

<p>competitiveness index rose slightly. According
to this evidence and other charts (S &amp; R, pp.281-283) current levels of
competitiveness are still below the long-run average.</p>

<p>In this analysis it is assumed that domestic
prices are synonymous with farm input price trends, though more
precise price measures for the non-tradeable sector are available.
Also, trends in commodity prices trend downwards compared with
overseas consumer pnces.</p>

<p>This discussion also ignores trends in
inter-sectoral productivity which can have an influence on survival
at a given level of competitiveness (Johnson, 1988).</p>

<p>Returning to the analysis of the
macro-parameters affecting agriculture, it is clear that the vital
components are exchange rate policy, monetary policy and fiscal
policy. These policies influence or direct changes in the domestic
price level, particularly in the non-tradeable sectors. Major
social and political considerations enter into the mix of policies
and sometimes it seems that the fall-out for agriculture is
incidental. This appears to be somewhat different from the balmy
days of export-led growth when a certain detachment was possible
from widespread wage claims and featherbedding practices,
countenanced by Governments of the day.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Given the remarkable stability of the real rate
of exchange in the long term, it does not appear that it is very
important which popular economic paradigm one follows. If anything,
the period since 1984 appears to be less 
 stable than the period before and therefore less certain for
producers. This has ramifications for producers' attitudes to risk
management, and for official policies for the producer boards and
other intermediary agents who manage and absorb the continuing
changes in exchange rates as well as fluctuations arising out of
commodity markets. </p>

<p>The current economic paradigm needs to be
examined on whether it delivers economic growth to society as well
as some of its more readily stated objectives like zero inflation
and enhanced efficiency. Considerations of world demand and
comparative advantage may not favour all current products or export
sectors. But all methods and sectors which can contribute to real
growth of output need to be re-examined to see if some impediment
to growth is unidentified within the market-led</p>

<p>framework currently favoured. I would be in
favour of any policy which more readily identified where we are
heading and what our prospects are. Current policy positions seem
to leave it all to chance.</p>

<p>This paper has turned into a review of the
Policy Services' book in spite of the best of intentions to be
unaffected by it. It is clear I agree with the macro-policy stance
taken in the book, but, am really quite unhappy with the
interpretation of micro-economic events in the past. As I say at
the beginning, one cannot interpret these micro-policies without
reference to the macro-framework in which they were formulated. The
authors of the book have too much concern for the outward "image"
of the policies they describe and too little appreciation of the
economic and social environment of the period concerned. It is a
significant contribution to the study of agricultural economics in
New Zealand, and is to be recommended on this score. However, the
real book on the place of agriculture in the total economy in the
years ahead has yet to be written.</p>
