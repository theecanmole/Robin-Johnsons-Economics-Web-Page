<p>Last conference my paper was on the impact of the foreshore and
seabed legislation on the existing land registration system (the
Torrens system)(Johnson 2004). The viewpoint taken was one of
formal property rights and their relationship to changing court
decisions regarding the ownership of foreshore and seabed land.
This paper enlarges on the institutional environment of property
rights in New Zealand, and draws on examples from Canada and
Australia. All three countries rely on various interpretations of
&uml;aboriginal law&uml; as set out in the courts in the three countries.
The paper argues that an institutional approach has some insights
to offer in democratic resolution of the kind of property law
issues raised by the pre- existance of
traditional/customary/primitive land rights. In recent
circumstances Maori title would exist even if there were no Treaty
of Waitangi.</p>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>The foreshore and seabed legislation in 2004 raised the issue of
what happens to customary rights when a country (or territory) is
occupied by a foreign power. In the C18 and C19 European
expansionism brought about the occupation of N America, S Africa,
Australia and New Zealand. Earlier the Spanish and the Portugeuse
occupied S America and parts of N America. The occupiers' legal
systems prevailed and the rights of indigenous inhabitants were
mostly ignored or severely discounted. Few provisions were made for
land and water rights that might have existed (in customary
law).</p>
<p>In broad terms, indigenous legal arrangements i.e. those
accepted by custom, made arrangements for exclusive use of land and
water where appropriate, and provided sanctions for the maintenance
of the arrangements. The foreshore and seabed legislation was an
exercise in clarifying what present-day legal systems had to say
about customary access to the foreshore, access to near fishing
resources, further distant fishing resources, and rights of
exclusivity resulting from traditional or customary
arrangements.</p>
<p>In reviewing these issues in 2003, the High Court had clarified
that such customary rights that could be substantiated before the
courts were fully recognisable and could be relevant to cases
before the Maori Land Court. In making this decision the Court
referred to the 'doctrine of aboriginal law' that had recently been
receiving considerable attention in land issues in both Canada and
Australia. This doctrine results from a progression of court
decisions in these countries that sought to identify and clarify
what customary rights survived foreign occupation and how the
common law should be adjusted to accommodate them.</p>
<p>In the various territories occupied by British settlers and
forces it was common for treaties to be struck with the indigenous
inhabitants and these may or may not have provided for preservation
of land and water customary rights (more details below). In
Australia, there was very little treaty making whereas in Canada
and New Zealand some of these rights appear to be reasonably
clearly specified. The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) is fairly specific
in stating that Maori would retain 'full exclusive and undisturbed
posession of their lands and estates forests fisheries and such
other properties as they may collectively or individually posess,
so long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their
posession. We know in practice that Maori lost control of most of
their lands either by sale or agreement with the settler government
or by dubious deals by some authorities. Nevertheless the Treaty
remains a powerful guiding tool to resolve disputes over land and
water rights as compared with Australia, say, where the
establishment of customary rights has become enmeshed in the
courts.</p>
<p>In this case, history is important in determining present day
rights. The legislature and the courts create the legal framework
that provides for the conduct of commerce and the resolution of
disputes. Property rights underlie all commerce and agreements and
negotiation and common agreement and acceptance of such rights
makes the institutional system workable. The relationship between
the courts and the legislature is of critical importance in what
can be achieved. &uml;Aboriginal law&uml; only applies of course to those
countries with dominant non-indigenous majorities and more direct
methods might be employed to re-establish customary rights in
countries like South Africa and Zimbabwe. We discuss here the appeal to
aboriginal law in Canada, Australia and New Zealand and its role in
resolving issues arising from surviving customary rights in land
and water.</p>

<h4>Institutional approaches</h4>
<p>Institutional economics relates to property rights, transaction
costs and all arrangements, formal and informal, that govern the
behavour of society and the conduct of commerce. It can relate to
the conduct of government organisations or to the behaviour of
family units in society. Institutional economists are fond of
saying that it is the details that are important.</p>
<p>In the present case, it is the study of traditional institutions
that are important to the resolution of the foreshore and seabed
issue. McLeod (2005) emphasises that intsitutional arrangements
dynamically determine as well as respond to the incentive structure
within society. He notes that institutional arrangements typically
evolve glacially in a path-dependent fashion such that they are
seen to be independent of rather than inter-dependent with
incentive structures. He supposes that apolitical institutional
arrangements evolve toward efficiency in their own settings. 'Adam
Smith's metaphor of the silent hand with respect to uncontaminated
markets is consistent with this. He notes that Posner
(unreferenced) advances an analogous conjecture with respect to the
development of an uncontaminated common law. By uncontaminated he
understands in the absence of material monopolies, externalities
and transaction costs. Her draws from these observations that the
institutional arrangements of pre-contact Maori which were
developed over at least 500 years were likely to have been
efficient in the sense that they evolved in the direction of
maximising output in that society given its particular technology
and resources.</p>
<p>McLeod quotes Posner's analysis (<i>The Economics of
Justice</i>, Harvard 1983, p.146), of so-called primitive economies
which found a remarkable similarity between institutional
arrangements between them which he believed were generally
efficient. Posner states &uml;I argue that many of ther distinctive
institutions of primitive society, including gift giving and
reciprocal exchange, polygamy and brideprices, the size of kinship
groups, and the value placed on certain personality traits such as
generosity, are best explained as adaptations to uncertainty&uml;.
McLeod interprets this as identifying best ways of managing risk
and (I assume) therefore totally rational.</p>
<p>In this paper, we examine the resolution of the foreshore and
seabed problem in an institutional perspective. It turns out that
Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all addressed the land
ownership problem in similar terms. The body of common law
developed is known as &uml;aboriginal law&uml;. It enables modern
institutions (the courts etc) to interpret what the so-called
primitive institutional situation was and how to recognise these
customary rights in the light of modern institutional
arrangements.</p>

<h3>Aboriginal Law.</h3>
<h4>Ownership and rights:</h4>
<p>According to McHugh (2003), the term &uml;ownership&uml; should be
treated as synonymous with full fee simple title to land or full
beneficial ownership - the right, in other words, to exclude
all-comers. He uses the term &uml;rights&uml;  to describe lesser rights
over land. &uml;Ownership&uml; is inherently exclusive. A particular
&uml;right&uml; such as a right to fish, may or may not be exclusive but it
is specific and defined by reference to the activity. Typically
someone holds &uml;rights&uml; over land in the ownership of another
person.</p>
<h4>Aboriginal title</h4>
<p>McHugh uses &uml;aboriginal title&uml; as a compendious term to describe
a set of rights that runs notionally from full ownership to
particular stand-alone rights. The term describes whatever interest
it is that common law will recognise as being held by tribal
peoples over a particular stretch of land or sea as a result of
their aboriginal connection with that area.</p>
<p>Where the aboriginal title is tantamount to ownership it can be
described as &uml;territorial aboriginal title&uml; and where it is not the
term &uml;non-territorial title&uml; can be used. Some use the term
&uml;customary rights&uml; instead of the label non-territorial, though
where this happens it must be emphasised that the talk is of the
common law breed of right rather than statutory jurisdiction of
legislation.</p>
<p>McHugh goes on to say that the common law doctrine of aboriginal
title provides a legal description of the property rights of
indigenous tribal peoples upon the Crown's assertion of sovereignty
over their territory. There is a common law presumption that those
property rights have survived the acquisition of sovereignty. The
doctrine is a legal, rather than a historical one, in that it does
not purport to describe a body of doctrinaire rules that were
consciously applied by imperial officials and colonial
functionaries during the nineteenth century. Rather, <i>it is a
modern-day judicial characterisation of certain historical facts
through which extant aboriginal property rights receive legal
protection in the courts</i>, rather than through their
historical</p>
<p>la of protection, the Crown itself. Common law aboriginal title
emerged, therefore, not as a historical truth, but as a legal
doctrine concerned with identification and articulation of extant
rights the protection of which public law was once (but no longer)
content to leave to executive discretion (my emphasis).</p>
<p>According to the Waitangi Tribunal (2004), Aboriginal title is
a general term that describes various &uml;sets&uml; of customary rights,
ranging from particular use rights (for example, to use a
particular area of foreshore as a pathway) through to the fullest
possible set of rights, equivalent to land ownership. Important
among the features of the common law doctrine of aboriginal title
are that:
<ul>
<li>it recognises customary rights that pre-dated  the Crown's
acquisition of sovereignty  and that have remained in existance,
making it, in essence, a 'preservationist' doctrine, and not, for
example, one that remedies the loss of customary rights;</li>
<li>it appreciates that customary rights may be held collectively,
are unique (<i>sui generus</i>)  and are identified in accordance
with the traditions and usages of the people who hold the
rights;</li>
<li>customary rights are inalienable except to the Crown, with the
result that such rights cannot be the subject of commercial transactions 
with third parties: they must first be  transformed
by lawful means into another kind of right.</li></ul>
<p>The Tribunal noted that the common law doctrine of aboriginal
title has not been much applied in NZ. As a result of the
Marlborough Sounds case, the way was opened by the Court of Appeal
for claims for customary rights to heard by both the Maori  Land
Court (MLC) and the High Court. The Court of Appeal judges' view,
contrary to the Crown's view of the matter, was that the MLC had
jurisdiction to determine the status of claims concerning the
foreshore and seabed. To reach their decision, the judges needed to
consider the application in NZ of the common law doctrine of
aboriginal title.</p>

<h4>Indian treaties and land claims in Canada</h4>
<p>Canada shares the common British parliamentary tradition with
Australia and New Zealand as well as, in common with New Zealand, 
the colonial practice of negotiating a treaty with its indigenous
peoples. The 'First Nations' people have sought to achieve
recognition, respect, reciprocity, and a more equitable sharing of
land, resource and decision-making authority with government
(Hayward and Price 2004). 'First Nations' is the term used in
Canada as a collective noun for earlier terms 'Indian band' and
'Indian tribe'. The term connotes 'a group of people with common
language, culture and history who identify with each other as
belonging to a common  political entity' (op cit, p.261).</p>
<p>Back to 1763. The Royal Proclamation set out Britain's
protection of Indian hunting grounds in North America,and provided
for a due process of treaty negotiations between the
representatives of the Crown and the First Nations of a particular
territory.  A number of Indian treaties were signed in Canada as a
result.  The proclamation amounted to a statement of intent rather
than a treaty as such (op cit, p.140). Historians regard  these
proclamations as confirming that the aboriginal people had rights
to land that <i>pre-existed</i> the assertion of British title, and
that it was incumbent on the Crown to extinguish those rights.</p>
<p>In the Maritime provinces the early treaties were 'peace and
friendship' treaties, with certain benefits for each side in terms
of their trading relationships and alliances, some of which
preceded the Proclamation of 1763. From the 1850s, the British
Crown (through its governors in Upper Canada) negotiated a series
of treaties known as the Robinson-Superior and Robinson-Huron
treaties in Ontario. These involved the surrender of Indian land
and resources in return for benefits such as annuities, reserve
lands, and continued hunting, fishing and trapping rights. These
treaties set the pattern for subsequent Indian treaties negotiated
between the Canadian government (after Confederation in 1867) and
First Nations on the prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
and Alberta.</p>
<p>A third series of treaties, known as the numbered treaties,
began in 1871 in Manitoba with Treaty No 1 and moved west as far as
the Rocky Mountains . The Crown sought to drive a tough bargain by
securing peace and access to the fertile lands of western Canada
for settlement and development. The First Nation negotiators were
shrewd bargainers and sought to maximise the benefits flowing to
their nations from the numbered treaties, including economic
assistance to take up agriculture, a medicine chest (or medical
provisions), and schools and teachers.</p>
<p>A final set of treaties was triggered by the Supreme Court of
Canada's <i>Calder</i> decision in 1973, whereby the majority of
the Court affirmed that aboriginal title was a fact of Canadian
legal history (although the Judges disagreed whether it still
existed in British Columbia, where few treaties were signed). This
decision compelled the government of Canada to revise its 1969
White Paper policy, which had effectively denied aboriginal rights
and title. The new 1973 Canadian Indian claims policy stated that,
in regard to the historical treaties, lawful obligations would be
upheld (op cit, pp.141-2). In 1982, aboriginal peoples in Canada
(Indian, Inuit, and Metis) were able to negotiate a constitutional
amendment that recognised treaty  and aboriginal rights (op cit,
p.140).</p>
<p>In British Columbia, Hayward and Price point out, government
denied the existence of aboriginal title until relatively recently,
and insisted the federal government should bear the burden for the
settlement of aboriginal rights and title. In the late 1980s,
however, the province came under increasing pressure from First
Nations court injunctions against logging companies and the
government over resource development, and from private sector
concerns about uncertainty and a loss of investment. In 1990, two
changes in approach were signalled; first the government agreed to
negotiate the Nisga's land claim with Canada and the Nisga's tribal
council. Second BC joined Canada and the First Nations Congress to
form the British Columbia Claims Task Force to address the issue of
aboriginal title in the province. In their first report, the Task
Force laid out nineteen guiding principles for the treaty making
process. These set the stage for political negotiations  between
First Nations, British Columbia and Canada, based on mutual trust,
respect and understanding (op cit, p.146). Out of this arose the
appointment of the British Columbia Treaty Commission to facilitate
treaty negotiations, a body not unlike the Treaty of Waitangi
Tribunal in New Zealand.</p>
<p>In general, the treatment of aboriginal title in Canada has been
more generous than in Australia and New Zealand. Although
aboriginal title had been recognised by the Canadian Courts since
1973 with the decision in <i>Calder</i>, it was only with the 1997
Supreme Court's decision in <i>Delgamuukw</i> that key issues
regarding aboriginal title were resolved and a clearer definition
of title was elucidated (Stephenson 2002/3, p.35). In this case,
aboriginal title was found to be based in both the relationship
between the common law and pre-existing systems of law, and in
Aboriginal pre-sovereignty occupation. It was found that aboriginal
title arises from the physical fact of occupation of peoples prior
to the Crown acquiring sovereignty. This title was considered to be
possessory title. Stephenson says that the most significant
findings from a natural resource perspective can be listed as
follows:</p>
<p>#  that aboriginal title is a right to the land itself;</p>
<p>#  that 'site specific' aboriginal rights and aboriginal title
are distinct;</p>
<p>#  that ownership of minerals, forest products and other natural
resources are part of aboriginal title.</p>
<p>The <i>Delgamuukw</i> decision guarantees that aboriginal title
holders had a clear right to choose how their lands will be used
and developed. <sup id="_ref-3" class="reference"><a class="f" href=
"#_note-3" title="">3</a></sup> The Canadian Supreme Court placed
certain limitations on the form of title which is otherwise fully
possessory. It is not transferable except through the Crown.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Native Title - &uml;Aboriginal Law&uml; in
Australia</b> <sup id="_ref-4" class="reference"><a class="f" href="#_note-4"
title="">4</a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1992 <i>Mabo</i> case, the High Court of Australia held
that the Meriam people had the right to posess their land on Mer
Island in the Torres Strait according to their <i>traditional law
and custom</i>. Australian law, for the first time, said that
aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have rights to their
country, according to their traditional laws and customs. These
rights may be recognised when people have maintained a continuing
connection with their land and waters and their rights have not
been removed by Government (National Native Title Tribunal
c1996). </p>
<p>Native title is the name given to the rights of these people and
is a unique form of land title, different from freehold or
leasehold titles. Native title cannot be bought or sold. Native
title is not a land right that Government gives to indigenous
people . It is a right <i>that already exists</i> in places where
indigenous people follow their traditional laws and customs and
have a continuing connection to their land and waters (op cit).</p>
In 1993 the Federal Government passed the Native Title Act. One of
the aims of the Act  was to help indigenous people have their
native title rights recognised without having to go to Court. The
Act also protected existing rights of governments, industry and the
general public. The Government set up the National Native Title
Tribunal as a place to receive native title applications. The
tribunal was to act as a mediator in negotiations as an independent
body.. The tribunal was not constituted as a Court: its role was to
ensure that any agreements reached recognised and respected the
rights and interests of all people involved in the best way
possible (Tribunal c1996).
<p>In 1996, the High Court observed that native title could
co-exist on a pastoral lease. The Wik people of Cape York
Peninsular had applied to have their native title recognised over
land where two pastoral leases had been granted by the Queensland
Government.. Previous to this, it was unclear whether pastoral
leases extinguished native title. Whether native title may survive
on a particular type of lease depended on the terms of the lease
and the relevant state legislation. <sup id="_ref-5" class=
"reference"><a class="f" href="#_note-5" title="">5</a></sup></p>
The Court said that native title holders and pastoralists could
<i>share</i> country; but that the rights of the pastoralists would
always take first place over native title rights (Tribunal c1996).
<p>Amendments in 1998 to the Native Title Act 1993 made a number of
changes to the administration of the native title recognition
process. Fletcher (2004, p.161) notes that the push to amend the
Act was led by pastoral and industry groups, who called for
stricter controls on the rights of native title claimants to
negotiate with industry bodies. Major changes included: native
title applications were to be made to the Federal Court instead of
the National Native Title Tribunal; the 'right to negotiate' on
pastoral leases and some other types of land tenures may change;
native title applicants are required to pass a new registration
test to gain the right to negotiate; new State and Territory
eqivalent bodies may assume any or all of the current
responsibilities of the National Native Title Tribunal under their
own legislation; people making application for a determination of
native tile will be required to confirm that they have the
authority of the people, clan or family for whom the application is
made (National Native Title Tribunal 1998).</p>
<p>The amendments also more clearly defined the status of
indigenous land use agreements (ILUAs)(Stephenson, op cit, p.60).
An ILUA is a voluntary agreement  between parties regarding the use
of native title land for resource development. Agreements can be
small scale through to large scale regional agreements. The
agreement covers future acts such as compulsory acquisition and
grants of mining interests. Matters covered by an ILUA  include the
doing of future acts; the imposition of conditions in relation to
the doing of future acts; the validation of future acts;  the
manner of exercise of any native title rights in an area; the
determination of compensation; and the extinguishment or surrender
of native title. Stephenson says an ILUA can be used as a bridge to
forming a long-term relationship between the resource developer and
the native title parties. They allow applicants to deal with a
whole range of future acts for a project and are not limited to
just prospecting. <sup id="_ref-7" class="reference"><a class="f" href=
"#_note-7" title="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Justice Cullinane (2002/3, p.16) remarks of this period that
there was high expectation that the <i>Wik</i> case would be turned
down by the High Court. He notes that its success  led to a
legislative response of the government which limited the common law
rights recognised by the Court in <i>Mabo</i> and <i>Wik.</i> He
notes that the jurisdiction of the national native title tribunal
has been challenged and at the time of writing the tribunal was not
dealing with these matters. Cullinane says that one consequence of
the <i>Mabo</i> judgement (and the later <i>Wik</i> judgement) was
the necessity to reconsider many of the principles underlying
property law. This was in order to determine the compatibility or
otherwise of rights with native title. The precise nature of
pastoral and other leases of Crown land and of mining titles has
had to be reconsidered.  Similarly in the <i>Mirrpun</i> case it
has been necessary to consider the position at common law in
relation to the sea and sea-bed (op cit, p.19).</p>
<p>Since then some authorities are of the view the promise of
reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians
has been further blown away by a <q>glacial avalanche of cases based
on native title claims</q> (Amankwah 2002/3). Native title has been
reduced from substantive interests in land to <q>a bundle of rights</q>
according to the interpretation the courts have put on the
definition of native title. The courts have also attributed to the
Native Title Act a codifying significance rather than Parliament's
intention to provide a regulatory scheme for the recognition of
native title and claims apurtenant to native title. They have also
inaugurated a regime of partial extinguishment of native title in
some circumstances (s24MD(2)(c) refers) (op cit, p.4). These
issues  appear to be the Australian equivalent of the foreshore and
seabed debate in New Zealand's jurisdiction (Johnson 2005).</p>
<p>Fletcher (2004) points out that the doctrine of native title is
the only option available to those who seek to enforce Aboriginal
land rights. The doctrine has in theory applied (along with the
rest of the common law) since Australia was first  settled as a
<i>terra nullius</i> (unoccupied territory) by the British.
However, as in New Zealand, the courts failed to uphold the
doctrine as they should have, and it was not until <i>Mabo</i>
(1992) that it was properly understood and applied. Fletcher says 
Australia's maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> is an
inconsistency that can largely be ascribed to historical European
perceptions of tribal organisation, especially the lack of
concentrated settlements, their loose organisation and their
migratory dispersion.</p>
<p>In the Nineteenth Century, British common law dictated that if a
colony were <q>settled</q>, common law applied from the time of
setlement <q>to the extent that it was appropriate to the condition
of the colony</q>. As the Australian colonies were viewed as settled
rather than acquired by conquest or cession, British law applied
and Aboriginal law was ignored, or <q>was not assumed to exist</q> at
all. Furthermore, although Australian Aborigines were in posession
of their land when the British arrived, international law stated
that <q>if the Crown decided to treat a territory which was sparsely
populated, or contained primitive peoples, as being unoccupied, it
would be classified as settled</q>. While successive governors were
issued with explicit instructions to provide for the Aborigines,
these were ostensibly fulfilled through the allocation of land for
their exclusive use (albeit land chosen by the government) and the
provision of rations as recompense for the loss of access to their
traditional foods.</p>
<p>No valid form of treaty was ever entered into in the history of
Australian settlement. Concomitantly, the systematic dispersal of
Aborigines from their traditional lands often occurred with no
official record of the means of dispersal and no identification of
the tribal lands (Fletcher 2004, pp.155-6).</p>
<h3>The case of customary coastal land in New Zealand</h3>
<p>Up to the High Court decision in 2003, it had been assumed that
customary rights had been extinguished by the signing of the Treaty
of Waitangi in 1840. This view was reflected in the Te Ture Whenua
Maori Act 1993 (<q>law for Maori land</q>) which consolidated the
various native land court statutes and confirmed the status of
existing Maori land and those rights which had already been
recognised. The Maori Land Court and the Maori Appellate Court are
constituted under the Act and have jurisdiction to hear matters
relating to Maori land (Yearbook 2002). In relation to foreshore
and seabed claims, the Marlborough iwi (tribal group) sought a
status order from the High Court declaring the foreshore and seabed
of their rohe (area) to be <i>customary land</i>. The group were
interested in the aquacultural potential of their ancestral lands
and waters. The government referred the issue to the Waitangi
Tribunal. In its report there is a full description of the
jurisdiction of the Maori Land Court as the Tribunal wished to
examine whether its powers extended to the foreshore and seabed
(Waitangi 2004).</p>
<p>For the purposes of the Act, <i>all</i> land in New Zealand must
have one of the following statuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maori customary land;</li>
<li>Maori freehold land</li>
<li>general land owned by Maori;</li>
<li>general land;</li>
<li>Crown land; or</li>
<li>Crown land reserved for Maori.</li>
</ul>
<p><q>Maori customary land</q> is described in the Act as <q>Land that is
held by Maori in accordance with tikanga Maori</q> (s129(2)(a)). It is
said to be a <q>residual</q> category of property for it comprises all
land not held or granted by the Crown (The Court of Appeal
determined that it can include coastal land covered by water).</p>
<p>The Act defines <q>tikanga</q> as <q>Maori customary values and
practices</q>. The Waitangi Tribunal interpret it as anything which
involves every aspect of the elements themselves and how humans
interact with them.(Waitangi Tribunal 2004, p.1). Professor Mutu
[in evidence] stated that it can mean any rule, plan or method;
custom, habit; anything normal or unusual; reason; meaning,
purport; authority, control; and correct, right; and involves the
widest range of Maori values (ibid p.1).</p>
<p>Unlike Australia, the occupation of New Zealand by Europeans in
the C19 was sanctified by a treaty with the indigenous inhabitants
(The Treaty of Waitangi 1840). At this time, the British colonial
administrators were insisting on settlers reaching an accommodation
with the existing inhabitants of newly  settled countries. The
Treaty established among other things that Maori would retain <q>full
exclusive and undisturbed posession of their lands and estates 
forests fisheries and such other properties as they may
collectively or individually posess, so long as it is their wish
and desire to retain the same in their posession</q>.</p>
<p>Governor Grey brought the Torrens land registration system with
him from S Australia in the 1840s. Registered land title was open
to all races and further legislation protected the rights of Maori
over subsequent years &amp; as in the provisions for the Maori Land
Court. The foreshore and seabed position with regard to customary
rights was never clearly defined and successive legislators came to
assume that all Maori rights were extinguished. It was this issue
which came befor the High Court and the Court of Appeal in 2003 in
the case concerning the Marlborough tribes' access to aquaculture
sites in Marlborough Sounds.</p>
<p>Government legislation in 2004 effectively nationalised the
foreshore and seabed and established a new property right
structure  that left room for claimants to establish the form of
any customary rights that remained. Maori who can prove an
uninterupted link to an area since 1840 will be able to request the
establishment of a reserve recognising their guardianship status.
Guardians will have a say in the management of the relevant areas.
<sup id="_ref-8" class="reference"><a class="f" href="#_note-8" title=
"">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Maori will need to apply to the High Court for a </q>territorial</q>
customary right order to establish a foreshore and seabed reserve,
or get other compensation from Government. The Minister of Finance,
Dr Cullen, said in the House that <q>the proposed Bill was a delicate
balance which reflects the actual common law rights position
codified into statute, no more no less</q>.</p>
<h4>My Interpretation</h4>
<p>This issue raises the wider constitutional issue of the impact
of  colonial occupation on indigenous people's rights when the
occupiers are now in the majority as in Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. Institutions and the legislature support the majority
view. <sup id="_ref-9" class="reference"><a class="f" href="#_note-9" title=
"">9</a></sup></p>
<p>One need only look at Zimbabwe land occupation to see what
happens when majority rule of another kind prevails!</p>
<p>Second, the nature of treaty making in the C19 clearly relates
to the earlier recognition of such customary land rights. In both
Canada and New Zealand the availability of earlier treaties enabled
processes of reconciliation to be embraced at an earlier date. In
Australia, the assumption of <i>terra nullis</i> (empty land) in
Australian law left a path open to endless litigation and appeal to
the courts as jurists and legislatures struggled to meet the buried
rights of their indigenous people.</p>
<p>Third, in all three countries it has taken jurists a
considerable time to embrace a new doctrine of <q>aboriginal law</q> and
apply it to their individual situations. This is man-made law.
Curiously enough, the respective governments have largely followed
the lead of the jurists although with bad grace at times as in this
case in New Zealand.</p>
<p>The recognition of these issues indicates that democratic
governments, albeit three based on the Westminster model, can move
by incremental steps to meeting a just solution to claims which
originate in customary folk law and held by only a minority.</p>
<p>It is not surprising therefore that Dr Cullen can regard the
foreshore and seabed issue  legislation in New Zealand as 
<q>reflecting the actual common law rights position codified into
statute, no more no less</q>! </p>

<li id="_note-5"><b><a href="#_ref-5" title="">^</a></b> The
original NTA was silent on the effect of previous valid government
acts on native title and therefore, the common law was the source
of authority for the effect of such acts. Although it was apparent
from <i>Mabo</i> and <i>Wik</i> that a grant of land or waters
conferring a right of exclusive posession over the area  was
inconsistent with the continued existence of native title and
therefore extinguishing native title that may have existed
previously, this position was not reflected in the NTA. Points 2
and 4 of the 10 Point Plan sought to confirm the Government's
undertanding of the post-<i>Wik</i> common law effect of certain
Commonwealth Acts on native title and to enable states and
territories  to similarly confirm the effect of acts done by them
on native title (Secher and Amankwah, 2002/3, pp.215-6).</li><p>
<li id="_note-6"><b><a href="#_ref-6" title="">^</a></b> The
legislation recognises and protects native title. Native title
holders are guaranteed the same safeguards against loss of title as
are enjoyed by other title holders (Stephenson, p. 56). The
language employed does not speak of remedies or redress. Yet
considerable progress has been made in the negotiations around
ILUAs. A total of 44 ILUAs were lodged with the registrar for
registration in 2003-04, an increase from 35 in the previous
reporting period. As at 30 June 2004, 131 ILUAs had been registered
since the change in the legislation in 1998. Queensland and NT are
the main areas of ILUA activity although there has been a gradual
uptake in other states (Annual Report, NNTT, 2003-2004). The NNTT
Librarian informs me that there has not been any real analysis done
on the effectiveness of ILUAs. This might be difficult as they are
confidential. See NNTT web list in references</li><p>

Faircheallaigh (2004) discusses the evaluation of agreements
between indigenous peoples and resource developers. She agrees that
there has been little study of the outcomes or results of agreement
making in practice. Preliminary indications were that, in the area
of resource management, outcomes from agreement making  were highly
variable. In some cases, indigenous peoples are achieving
substantial economic benefits and innovative provisions to minimise
the impact of commercial activities on their traditional lands. In
other cases the benefits gained are neglible, impact provisions are
similar to those already provided in general legislation, while in
some cases, restrictions are placed on the exercise of rights that
the parties posess under general legislation. A thorough analysis
of outcomes from agreements for indigenous interests was
indicated.</li><p>
