<p class='nav center'>10th Annual Conference of the NZ Society of Agricultural Economics, Blenheim, June 2004</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p class='abstract'>Previous papers at this conference
over the years have dealt with trends in productivity in the total agricultural
sector, the forestry sector and the dairy sector. Productivity indexes were
developed by the Tornquist methodology that produces index numbers free of base
year bias. Sources of data are the national accounts for the total agricultural
and forestry sectors and designated farm surveys for the dairy and sheep
sectors. The surveys are taken as representative of the whole in such
calculations. In this paper we analyse the Meat and Wool Information Economic
Service (MWI) survey of sheep and beef farms for the past 20 years and develop
an index of whole farm productivity (total productivity) free of base year
bias. Some technical comparisions are made with productivity trends in Landcorp
which had a fairly similar product mix in the period concerned.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Productivity analysis is useful in
isolating underlying trends in efficiency in a sector or industry apart from
price and income variations. The analysis utilises index numbers that are
formulated to reflect as true as possible changes in the productive use of
physical resources. </p>

<p>The models employed are based on the Solow
methodology. Basicly, the production function is assumed Cobb Douglas with
total output as a function of labour, capital and non-factor inputs. The
identity of resources used to output produced is completed by adding another
variable representing efficiency gains from better organisation and better
input qualities etc. This remains unmeasured and is included in the error terms
of the Cobb Douglas specification. Solow called this 'the residual' and it
includes all the unmeasured factors which might bear on changes in efficiency
in production. In what follows, the production function is assumed to employ
non-factor inputs so the residual includes influences not taken into account
after labour, capital and non-factor inputs are accounted for.</p>

<p>For sources of data, we employ standard
farm surveys like MWIES and Dexcel or national income statistics which are
aggregations of the farm surveys under certain circumstances. This assumes that
the farm surveys are representative of the whole population to which they
refer. National income statistics are representative of the sectors from which
they are drawn.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
 
<p>We use the Tornqvist formulation of the divisia index number.  To overcome the base year bias problem in volume indexes (and price indexes<i>), </i>the
Tornqvist discrete approximation to a Divisia Index defines the output index, <i>O</i><i>&nbsp;<sup>*</sup></i>&nbsp;<i><sub>t</sub></i>&nbsp;, as the weighted change in the proportions of its base weighted and current
weighted components:</p>

<p>(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-family: roman, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 1.3em; font-style: italic">O &nbsp;<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;<sub>t</sub> = &#8721;i(O<sub>ti</sub>/O<sub>oi</sub>)<sup>1/2 (w<sup>ti</sup> + w<sup>oi</sup>)</sup></span></p>

<p class='blocktext'>where <i>w<sub>ti</sub> </i> = the share of the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> output <i>(j<sup>th</sup></i> input) in total nominal
output (input) in year <i>t</i>, and</p>

<p class='blocktext'><i>w<sub>oi</sub></i> = the share of the <i>i<sup>th</sup></i> output (<i>j<sup>th</sup></i> input) in total nominal output (input) in the base year.</p>

<p>This can be transformed by logarithms to the base <i>e</i> to give the estimation formula:</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-family: roman, 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 1.3em; font-style: italic">ln O &nbsp;<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;<sub>t</sub> = &#8721;i 1/2 (w<sup>ti</sup> + w<sup>oi</sup>)
 ( ln O<sub>ti</sub> - ln O<sub>oi</sub>)</span></p>

<p>By taking anti-logs, the base year takes on a value of unity. The resulting index numbers
now represent a moving weighted geometric average of base year output
quantities and the current output quantities.</p>

<p>In more practical terms, one assembles the values for the mix of products or inputs and deflates them with an appropriate price index. These are then volume indexes for each product or input category.
Tornqvist weighting is bringing these products or inputs together in one volume
index in a way that is representative of changes in the mix. As equation (2)
shows, we weight by the average of the value shares in the current year and the
base year i.e. a system of moving weights.</p>

<p>The productivity index is the ratio of
weighted output to the index of weighted input. This is whole farm productivity
and is not to be confused with factor productivity. Forbes and Johnson talk
about total input productivity for the whole farm concept (TIP). DEXCEL have
shortened this to TP. Factor productivity is the ratio of real net income to
the factors labour and capital divided by the weighted index of capital and
labour inputs. </p>

<p>As explained previously, this definition of
productivity relates to the use of real measured resources used only. In Solow
terms, the difference between inputs and outputs as measured or changes in the
ratio is due to 'unexplained' or unmeasured factors bearing on better
organisation of farm resources.</p>

 

<h2>Data</h2>

 

<p>For the output index, we divide the income
stream into livestock products and wool. We deflate these series by the MWI
export price indexes for all products and wool respectively.</p>

 

<p>For the input index, we divide the
expenditure stream into fertiliser/lime/seeds (FLS), R&amp;M, and other
expenses (O), excluding wages, interest on borrrowings and depreciation. The
latter two are regarded as book entries on the use of capital resources and are
not required in getting to a real measure of capital use. Wages are
re-allocated to residual farm income as part of the total reward to labour.
Price series for FLS, R&amp;M and O are taken from Statistics NZ farm input
prices; 'fertiliser', 'maintenance', and 'taxes'.</p>



<p>Labour employed is measured by the MWI as
the total of owners', managers', permanent, and casual labour in their survey.
Capital employed is measured by deflating the balance sheet assets by suitable
price indexes. Land and Buildings by the Quotable Value NZ index of 'rural'
farm land prices at year end, plant and machinery by the Statistics NZ index of
plant machinery and equipment in the capital goods price index at the beginning
of the year; and livestock valuation by the Statistics NZ index of livestock
purchased prices on 'sheep farms' as at the month of December.</p>


<p>Weights for the output series are the
relative sales proportions of livestock products and wool each year. Weights
for the input index are the the proportions of FLS, R&amp;N, O, L and C. in
total income each year. FLS, R&amp;M and O are the accounting entities for
these items; C is the opportunity cost of total real assets at 4% per year and
L is the residual labour income left to farmers and employees after the above
four are deducted from total farm revenue. </p>

 

<h2>Results</h2>

 

<p>Table 1 shows the weighted indexes for
output, inputs and TIP for the period since 1987-88. Table 2 shows the partial
productivities for FLS, R&amp;M, Other, Labour and Capital stocks. Chart 1
corresponds to Table 1 and Chart 2 corresponds to Table 2.</p>

<p>Average output has increased steadily at
2.6% per year since 1987-88. Up to 1998-99 total input increased at less than
this rate but has since increased significantly to give overall growth of
inputs at 3.5%. As a result, productivity has turned downwards over these
latter years. As shown below there has been a build-up of capital assets and
R&amp;M in recent years which results in a down-turn in the productivity
measure. The partial productivities show that labour has been used most
economically followed by other expenses, assets, R&amp;M and FLS in that order.
Apparently, higher outputs cannot be obtained without higher input of
fertiliser, lime and seeds and repairs and maintenance have to be kept up to
date.</p>


 
<br  clear=ALL>

<p>The level of inputs fluctuates with the
cash flow on farms. In down years productivity rises faster. This is generally
explained by an investment hypothesis whereby the build-up of current
expenditure in good cash flow years represents higher investment in the
productive capacity of sheep farm properties. On the other hand, when expenditure
is rationed, previous investment comes through in the form of higher output and
hence productivity.</p>

 

<p>Table 3 and Chart 3 show comparisions of
the sheep sector with the dairy sector (Anderson and Johnson 2002), Landcorp
and the national average (from national income data)(Forbes and Johnson 2000).
Landcorp has a similar product mix to the sheep sector and should show some
similarities (Landcorp data published by special permission). </p>

 

<p>Landcorp does not follow the sheep sector
particularly well especially after 1994. This appears to be due to a change in
valuation method at Landcorp around this time which made the MWI price indexes
inapplicable. (In the case of Landcorp a better result was obtained by
estimating the direct weight of livestock sold off farms instead of the price
index methodology). Dairy owner-occupiers show a low rate of productivity
growth in the early 1990s but a steady increase of around 2.4% per year since.
National productivity growth was not as
good as the sheep sector up to 1998 but has not declined in the the way the
sheep sector has since (see explanation above). National productivity grew at
0.8% over the period since 1987-88.</p>

<h2>The case of Landcorp</h2>

<p>Landcorp showed steady growth from 1987-88
to 1993-94 and then changed its method of accounting for livestock sales. This
resulted in Landcorp recording a fall in overall output in 1994-95 and 1995-96.
With the same input structure, productivity on resources used dropped. It has
to be questioned whether the MWI price indexes are applicable to Landcorp over
this period. Output then recovered in the following years and productivity
increases followed as well until 2002-03 when total inputs increased rapidly as
Landcorp embarked on a new investment program. The productivity measure fell
off as a result. It should rise steadily again as the investment program bears
fruit.</p>

<p>If the same methodology was followed throughout,
the national result should be approximately the average of the component sector
parts. As indicated, sheep, dairy and Landcorp are based on farm accounts
while the national estimate is based on the aggregates of the national income
statistics. Bryan Philpott disaggregated the national accounts a few years ago and estimated that
horticulture was the key to productivity growth in agriculture as measured in
terms of <i>factor productivity</i> (Table 4). Factor productivity growth tends
to be higher than total input or whole farm productivity:</p>
