Presented to the Australian Agricultural Economics Society Meeting,
Queenstown, New Zealand, February 14, 2007. The paper
discusses the respective procedures used by The Foundation for
Research, Science and Technology and the Tertiary Education
Commission for allocating funds for public investment in R &amp; D in
New Zealand. The theme of the paper is that if financial portfolio
analysis were available to the decision makers a better account
would be taken of the risk-tradeoffs in such investment. The paper
discusses why this is not possible due to data limitations and lack
of analytical techniques.</p></li></ul>

<br>This paper continues the theme of earlier papers with regard to public funding
of R &amp; D in New Zealand. The Crown Research Institutes receive a
major share of the Government funds made available. Those
institutes specialising in agricultural research have lost share of
government funds, though others have gained. To some extent, the
agricultural institutes have made up their funding from private
sector sponsorship.</li>

<br />By Robin Johnson, Frank Scrimgeour and Julian Manning. This paper on public
investment in agricultural R &amp; D was published in <i>Farm Policy
Journal</i>, Vol 31 No. 1, February Quarter, 2006. The paper
discusses the science reforms in New Zealand in 1990-91 and their
impact on the research institutes specialising in agricultural
research. One of the aims of the reforms was to encourage more
private investment in R &amp; D. Following a belief in <q>crowding-out</q>
theory the state managers subsequently starved the agricultural
sector of public funds for some years with consequent reductions in
essential investment in animal and plant research particularly. In
recent years, the agricultural research interests have combined
together to present government with a coordinated and coherent plan
for increased investment, both private and public, in the
agricultural sector. A positive response from Government has yet to
emerge.</li>

This paper, presented to the NZ Association of Economists in June 2006, is an update
on the earlier papers in this section. A problem with the earlier
papers has been the lack of data on private investment in R &amp; D
in the years before 1990, when official surveys commenced. In this
paper I explore two new proxies for private investment for the
period 1965 to 1990. By using regression examples drawn from the
earlier work a variable based on public grants to the private
sector was found best. This paper includes the new data series
needed to replace earlier data sets.</li>

<br />This paper reviews earlier papers on the organisation
of R &amp; D in New Zealand. It was presented to the NZ Society of
Agricultural Economists on August 26, 2005. After discussing data
sources for time series analysis the paper discusses the generally
poor econometric relationships between national investment in
R &amp; D and industry level income. The reasons for this lie in the
dominance of government R &amp; D in NZ and the loose connections
between R &amp; D investment decisions and possible applications. It
is argued that for better demonstration of such relationships,
analysis should be concentrated on project by project cost-benefit
studies of which there are too few.</li>

Since 1991, the New Zealand Government has allocated public R &amp; D funds through a pool system - called the public good research fund - through which research providers (universities, research institutes etc) must bid for funding on a project by project basis. This system was to counteract a previous tendency for public funding through departmental structures to discourage private sector investment - crowding out. The funding administrators were enjoined to take account of the private appropriability of the projects submitted and direct public funds to complementary projects or projects which would otherwise be under-funded. This paper finds evidence of increased private sector participation in research funding, and a declining share going to research provision over the last 9 years. The Crown Research Institutes appear to be the main beneficiaries.</li>

<br/>This seven-page paper, presented to winter meeting of the NZ Association of Economists, Wellington, in July 2000, discusses some of the difficulties in
defining the notion of a knowledge base [for R &amp; D] for use in
econometric analysis. The use of a capital stock concept is
explored at different rates of depreciation and compared with
models based on polynomial distributed lags. The latter give more
plausible results in terms of delays in response rates and results
are presented for 10 subsectors of the NZ market economy.</li>

The Rate of Return to New Zealand Research and Development
Investment (1999)</a>. <br />This 14-page study is based on time series analysis
(1962-98) of nine economic sectors in the NZ economy relating
investment in R &amp; D to changes in gross domestic product. The
basic model is Cobb-Douglas and R &amp; D enters either as a stock
variable or as a distributed lag variable. The best results are
obtained from the latter specification. Also available from <a href="http://www.maf.govt.nz/MAFnet/publications/techpapers/researchdev/rdinvest03.htm">MAF</a>.</li>
