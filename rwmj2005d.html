<h1>The Structure and Economic Impact of R &amp; D Organisation in
New Zealand</h1>
<p class='center'>By</p>

<p class='abstract'>R &amp; D spending in New Zealand is a mixture
of private and public investment undertaken to improve productive
activity and efficiency. Investment is split fairly equally between
private business, government organisations and the universities. It
is a long term investment with some uncertainty about outcomes
being achieved. It is predominantly a public good investment as
most government organisations and universities are providers of R
&amp; D but not users of it and hence there is a discontinuity in
the connection between investment and results. Furthurmore, the
supply of R &amp; D has properties of a free good which lead to
users looking for new applications on a wider and wider front
(spillovers). For these reasons R &amp; D is generally regarded as
a "good thing" rather than a "solid investment vehicle".
Cost-benefit studies have shown, both in New Zealand and overseas,
some projects with rates of return well in excess of the
opportunity cost of capital, yet at the aggregate level there is a
paucity of cost-benefit studies confirming such rates of return on
a broader industry basis. This paper discusses some results from
aggregate studies of the economic impact of R &amp; D investment in
NZ and suggests reasons why the links between aggregate supply of R

&amp; D and user demand are very weak.</p>
<p class='blocktext'>Key Words: Investment, R &amp; D Expenditure,
Social Benefits.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h2>A Little History</h2>
<p>By structural analysis, it is meant the institutional
organisation of an industry may have some bearing on the impact of
that industry on other industries. Institutional economics lays
considerable stress on the relation between performance and
structure. In the case of the science industry in New Zealand the
institutions originally developed in a government-sponsored
framework that some writers believe 'crowded out' private
investment. Two large departments, the Department of Agriculture
and the Department Scientific and Industrial Research, were created
in a framework where it was thought individual producers could not
afford to pay for research in their own interests. Even so, in the
post-war years the DSIR was responsible for setting up a number of
industrial research associations (DRI, WRO, MIRC) with joint
funding from Government and industry. By reason of specialisation
and skills, the universities were a separate institutional entity
in the science industry, which largely drew on Government funding
for this activity which was considered as a desirable adjunct of
training in science on which they had a monopoly.</p>
<p>These relationships were changed by the reforms in the science
establishment in the early 1990s which removed science from DSIR
and MAF and created a series of subject research institutes
(AgResearch etc) with private company charters. At the same time
the Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (MoRST) was
established as the policy body responsible for science and the
Foundation of Research Science and Technology (FRST) was
established as the funding body for government funds with a mandate
to organise science funding on a competitive bidding process
(Johnson 2000).</p>
<h2>Measurement of Effort</h2>

<p>Another aspect of these reforms was an endeavour to find out how
much exactly was spent on both private and public R &amp; D. This
task was entrusted to MoRST and started in the 1989 expenditure
year. The survey was taken over by Statistics New Zealand in 2002.
It is this survey which informs most of the comments and analysis
presented in this paper.</p>
<p>Organisations which carry out R &amp; D are called 'research
providers' and the organisations which finance research are
called 'research funders'. Private sector providers are called
business (BERD), government (GERD) and universities (HERD for
higher education) and are both providers and funders as are
business. 'Providers' is the basis of all analytical tables
used in this paper. The old research associations (DRI, WRO etc)
are considered to be private providers of R &amp; D. MoRST spent
considerable effort in identifying output class areas which were
categories based on the purposes of R &amp; D used for public
science funding ( MoRST Survey 1997, p. 27). Up to 2000, MoRST
asked in the questionaires what output or outputs each
firm/department/organisation was providing science services to? (I
assume there was space for a multiple answer). In research
utilising the MoRST output area data, we reclassify these outcome
categories to fit ANZSIC (industry classification). Statistics New
Zealand classifies BERD by ANZSIC categories and GERD by the
appropriate ANZSIC categories This means that the meaning and
intent of science output class areas has been put aside.</p>
<p>In addition to the MoRST Surveys (1989-2004), earlier statistics
of R &amp; D spending were collected by The National Research
Advisory Council (NRAC) and Government Departments. These figures
were assessed under various subject areas which approximated
roughly to the output areas used by MoRST. In this way spending
statistics by the private sector, universities and Government were
extended back to 1961-62 for the following industry sectors:</p>
<ul>

<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Fishing</li>
<li>Forestry</li>
<li>Processing</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Building&amp;Construction</li>
<li>Transport</li>

<li>Other Services</li>
<li>Market Sector (ie excluding owner-occupied dwellings and
government services).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cost-benefit Analysis</h2>
<p>The economic impact of R &amp; D needs to be analysed in some
benefit-cost framework. Earlier studies have included a study by
Scobie and Eveleens of the agriculture sector where fairly clear
records of research and extension expenditure had been kept (Scobie
&amp; Eveleens 1986). This study related R &amp; D expenditure to a
total productivity ratio (gross return/total input) for the sector
drawn from the work of B.P. Philpott (1969). The Scobie and
Eveleens study of agricultural productivity from 1926 to 1984 used
a model in which the observed level of total productivity in
agriculture in each year was dependent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the weather conditions (as measured by an index of soil
moisture deficits) in the previous year;</li>

<li>the level of spending on extension services;</li>
<li>the number of graduates and diplomats trained in the
agricultural sciences (including horticulture, veterinary science,
food technology) over the past 15 years;</li>
<li>the economic conditions of the agricultural sector (as measured
by the annual deviation of net farm income from its long term
trend); and</li>
<li>the real spending on agricultural research in that year, and in
each of the preceding years (up to 30 years earlier).</li>
</ul>
<p>The results showed that, on average, research results are slowly
incorporated [in the case of livestock farming] into practice and
their impact on productivity increased reaching a peak after 11
years and finally tailing off after a total of 23 years. In terms
of research expenditure alone [i.e. holding other variables
constant], $1m of research expenditure generated total benefits of
$8.5m over the following 23 years, giving an internal rate of
return of 30 per cent.</p>
<p>In agricultural circles, the total productivity ratio seems the
obvious way to study production changes resulting from adoption of
scientific procedures. On a wider industry basis, net output or
value added is the statistical measure of production recorded. A
productivity ratio like total factor productivity might then be
employed (net output/weighted capital and labour inputs) for
testing R &amp; D impacts. If the underlying function adopted is
Cobb Douglas then it may be relevant to make net output the
dependent variable in the R &amp; D analysis. Some of these
variants are discussed later in the paper.</p>

<p>It has to be said that these are aggregate industry studies
dependent on national collections of statistics. Project level data
or even programme level data (within an organisation) may be a more
precise approach to cost benefit studies.</p>
<h2>R &amp; D and the Stock of Knowledge</h2>
<p>The question remains as to where an industry obtains its R &amp;
D knowledge. A stock of knowledge is built up in continuing
investment by public and private agencies both in NZ and overseas.
It could be that all knowledge is available to everybody and one
just has to plug into it. Some industries may generate their own.
Or is part of the stock of knowledge specific to particular users
or industries or locked up by legal means such as patents?. The
MoRST system of science output area classes suggests that science
<i>users</i> can be categorised in a useful way and R &amp; D can
be something specific to a group of users. This kind of hypothesis
can be tested by relating productivity gains in an industry to
<i>specific</i> sets of R &amp; D knowledge (organised around
science output area classes) or the <i>general</i> body of R &amp;

D knowledge. If one industry draws from another industry this is a
form of economic spillover. It is thus quite important to examine
where a group finds its relevant R &amp; D knowledge and to look
for links between groups.</p>
<h2>Background Data Sets: R &amp; D Statistics</h2>
<p>Table 1 shows R &amp; D expenditure from a provider point of
view since 1990. National expenditure on R &amp; D has risen from
$725m in 1990-91 to $1467m in 2003-04. As can be seen, the amount
has grown in line with the growth of national GDP. As far as the
main providers are concerned, government has slowly withdrawn from
research provision while the private sector and the universities
have increased their share.</p>

<h2>National Data</h2>
<p>Figure 1 shows the division of the R &amp; D spending between
the 3 main sectors in real terms since 1961. From 1989 the data is
based on the MoRST surveys. For the intermediate years in which
MoRST did not carry out a survey, the expenditure has been
extrapolated in proportion to changes in nominal GDP. Prior to
1989, the NRAC data for Government expenditure is used. For
Universities a fixed proportion of the Government Block Grant is
used. For Business the proportion of business expenditure to
nominal GDP in 1989 is carried back to 1961-62.</p>
<p>Real expenditure by Government was rising rapidly up to the
early 1980s but has since plateaued with quite a reduction in real
terms in the 1980s. The trend in University expenditure up to the
late 1980s reflects the Block Grant allocation and is only a guide
to actual R &amp; D expenditure by the Universities. In the private
sector the trend reflects GDP growth and is only an approximation
to what private enterprise might have spent on R &amp; D.</p>

<h2>Individual Industry Data</h2>
<p>The impact of R &amp; D investment will be felt in the longer
run in production levels and efficiency. One approach is to observe
production changes as reflected in real national product and seek
explanatory changes in capital employed, labour employed and
previous R &amp; D investment.</p>
<p>The two approaches are related. Both can be derived from a
production function of the form:</p>
<p>(1) <i>Y = A K<sup>a</sup> L<sup>b</sup></i>,</p>

<p class='ind'>where</p>
<p class='ind'><i>Y</i> is output:</p>
<p class='ind'><i>A</i> is productivity;</p>
<p class='ind'><i>K</i> is the stock of physical capital; and</p>
<p class='ind'><i>L</i> is labour.</p>

<p>If productivity can be explained by the stock of knowledge
capital and other factors, then equation (1) can be rewritten
as:</p>
<p>(2) <i>Y = K<sup>a</sup> L<sup>b</sup> R<sup>g</sup>
Z<sup>s</sup></i>,</p>
<p class='ind'>where <i>R</i> is the stock of knowledge capital;
and</p>

<p class='ind'><i>Z</i> is other factors affecting measured
productivity.</p>
<p>In the production function approach, a log linear version of
equation (2) is estimated directly:</p>
<p>(3) <i>ln Y = a ln K + b ln L + g ln R + s ln Z,</i></p>
<p>with no further restrictions placed upon the parameters. The
estimate of <i>g</i> would provide a direct estimate of the
percentage increase in output obtainable from a one per cent
increase in knowledge stocks, holding all other factors
constant.</p>
<p>In the two-step productivity approach, equation (3) would be
rewritten as :</p>
<p>(4) <i>ln Y - a ln K - b ln L = g ln R + s ln Z</i></p>

<p>Under the additional assumptions that <i>a + b</i> = 1 and that
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> equal capital and labour income shares, the
left-hand side of (4) equals multi-factor productivity (in level,
not growth form), as conventionally measured in a growth accounting
framework. Observations on multi-factor productivity can then be
regressed on the variables shown on the RHS.</p>
<p>In either case, estimates of the parameter <i>g</i> can be
converted from an elasticity to an overall rate of return
<i>dY/dR</i> as given by:</p>

<p>(5) <i>dY/dR = g (Y/R).</i><a class='f' href="#_ftn2" name=
"_ftnref2" title=""><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>The capital variable <i>K</i> is derived from capital
expenditure data by the perpetual inventory method:</p>
<p>(6) <i>K<sub>t</sub> = (1 - f) K<sub>t-1</sub> +
E<sub>t-1</sub></i></p>

<p class='ind'>where</p>
<p class='ind'><i>K<sub>t</sub></i> = the stock of conventional
capital at the beginning of period t in constant prices;</p>
<p class='ind'><i>K<sub>t-1</sub></i> = the stock of capital at the
beginning of period t-1;</p>
<p class='ind'><i>E<sub>t-1</sub></i> = capital expenditure during
period t-1 in constant prices; and</p>

<p class='ind'><i>f</i> = the depreciation or obsolescence rate of
capital.</p>
<p>In this study, Philpott's data on capital employed in different
sectors is utilised. Philpott does not use diminishing balance
depreciation rates but substitutes a formula taking in the average
life of assets (Philpott 1994). These estimates of the capital
employed are about 50 per cent greater than those determined by
book depreciation methods (Philpott 1995).</p>
<p>The perpetual inventory method is also applied to the R &amp; D
variables. The expenditures shown in Figure 1 are transformed as in
equation (6). Knowledge is regarded as a stock of available
technologies which can be added to and subtracted from. The
reduction process can be treated as the depreciation factor. The
initial stock of knowledge has to be established from the available
data by a formula of the kind:</p>
<p>(7) <i>S<sub>o</sub> = E<sub>o</sub> / (e + f),</i></p>

<p>where</p>
<p class='ind'><i>S<sub>o</sub></i> = the stock of R &amp; D
capital at the beginning of the first year for which expenditure
data is available;</p>
<p class='ind'><i>E<sub>o</sub></i> = the annual expenditure on R
&amp; D (in constant prices) during the first year;</p>
<p class='ind'><i>e</i> = the average annual logarithmic growth of
R &amp; D expenditures for the nearest relevant years; and</p>

<p class='ind'><i>f</i> the depreciation or obsolescence rate of
knowledge.</p>
<p>The assumption is that if the stock had been growing
<i>before</i> the first year at a certain rate, then the estimate
of the total starting stock will be that much higher than it would
have been if expenditure were capitalised by the rate of
depreciation alone. In the estimates used in this paper <i>e</i>
was estimated for the first ten years after 1962, and <i>f</i> was
set at 5 per cent per year. Thus the starting stock for the market
sector is:</p>
<p>(8) S<sub>o</sub> = $86.3m / (0.1 + 0.05)</p>

<p class='blocktext'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
$575.3m (in $1982-83)</p>
<p>The choice of a rate of depreciation of a knowledge stock is a
difficult question. It seems clear that new inventions and ways of
doing things <i>replace</i> older inventions and ways. The stock is
thus a moving entity - constantly wasted and constantly
replenished. Evidence is lacking on what is the appropriate course
of action. Scobie and Eveleens (1986) note that "average research
results are slowly incorporated into practice and their impact on
productivity increases [in agriculture] reaching a peak after 11
years, and finally tailing off after a total of 23 years". This
suggest a "life" of research of about 20 years with the maximum
effect in the mid years of that period. Thus a rate of 5-10 per
cent might be quite appropriate for a country like New Zealand -
the results presented here are calculated at 5 per cent.</p>
<p>The second approach is to isolate the productivity change as a
residual after capital and labour returns have been allowed for.
This is the total factor productivity index (TFP) which is defined
as the net output of an industry divided by the weighted sum of the
labour and capital inputs used. In national accounting terms the
ratio is:</p>
<p>(9) <i>TFP<sub>i</sub> = Y<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;/&nbsp;

a<sub>i</sub>L<sub>i</sub> + b<sub>i</sub>K<sub>i</sub></i></p>
<p>where <i>a<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>b<sub>i</sub></i> are the
average factor shares of income in nominal terms for the
i<sup>th</sup> industry. For example, in the market sector as a
whole the share of L is 0.60 and K is 0.40.</p>

<p>The TFP index can be regarded (by re-arrangement of (9) above)
as the weighted mean of the labour and capital productivity
indices:</p>
<p>(10) <i>TFP<sub>i</sub> = a<sub>i</sub>(Yi / Li) +
b<sub>i</sub>(Yi / K i).</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The actual data and factor shares from the Philpott data set are
available in the form:</p>
<p><i>Y</i> <i><sub>it</sub></i>. Real GDP by SNA industry group
($m in 1982-83 prices).</p>

<p><i>L</i> <sub>it</sub>. Employment in SNA industry groups (`000
full time equivalents).</p>
<p><i>K</i> <sub>it</sub>. Real gross capital stock by SNA industry
group ($m in 1982-83 prices).</p>
<p><i>a</i><sub>i</sub> and <i>b</i> <sub>i</sub>. Average factor
shares in nominal $.</p>

<p>The ratios in equation (10) are shown in Figure 2 for the
national market economy with base year weights (n.b. excluding
owner-occupied dwellings and government services).</p>

<h3>Rates of return to R &amp; D in the Agriculture Sector</h3>
<p>We first test the Cobb-Douglas hypothesis (Equations (2) and
(3)) in a step-wise manner for the market economy and for the
agriculture sector(Tables 5 and 6). The variables are:</p>
<p class='blocktext'>Sectoral Real GDP as a function of:<br />
Labour in full time equivalents (Philpott)<br />
Real Capital Gross Stocks (Philpott)<br />

Real Stocks of Private R &amp; D depreciated at 5%<br />
Real Stocks of Public R &amp; D depreciated at 5%<br />
Real Stocks of Australian R &amp; D (reflecting a source of
external spillovers)<br />
Real Expenditure on Education in NZ (reflecting upgrading of
skills)</p>
<p>In Table 5, hypothesis a. has good properties for expected
values for Labour and Capital approximating to their factor shares.
In hypothesis b. private R &amp; D is highly positive but public R

&amp; D highly negative. In hypothesis c. both external factors are
not significant. In Table 6 the Cobb-Douglas fit is very poor;
there is again a high return to private R &amp; D and a negative
return to public R &amp; D; no influence from Australian R &amp; D;
but a suggestion of an influence from skill levels in the
economy.</p>
<p>Table 7 shows the regression results derived from equation (4).
The dependent variable is now total factor productivity as defined
in equation (9). Constant factor shares (averages) were used as
weights for capital and labour inputs. We also show the RORs for
these results as derived by the formula in equation (5). For MK the
size of the R &amp; D coefficient is smaller but of the same sign.
For AGR the R &amp; D coefficients are barely changed from Table 6.
Australian R &amp; D comes through as significant for MK and AGR
and EDU cames through in AGR again. The ROR for PVTR &amp; D is
quite high in both equations but the ROR for PUBR &amp; D is low
and negative.</p>

<p>All of these results utilise stocks of R &amp; D knowledge as an
independent variable. As already indicated, the stock of knowledge
concept is rather hypothetical and its rate of wastage or
depreciation equally so. Table 8 shows the sensitivity of the
results in Table 7 to changes in the wastage rate. (There is a
small change in the specification that changes the earlier result
slightly). It appears that manipulation of the wastage rate is
compensatory; the elasticity decreases as the wastage rate
increases and the rate of return rises slightly in each case.</p>

<p>MoRST has been extremely concerned about the negative
relationship between public R &amp; D stocks and the two
productivity measures employed. In terms of the industry breakdown
employed in the larger study, private R &amp; D stocks are
positively related to changes in TFP in 7 cases out of 10; public R
&amp; D is positively related to changes in TFP in 4 cases out of
10; external R &amp; D is positively related to changes in TFP in 7
cases out of 10; and education expenditure is positively related to
changes in TFP in 4 cases out of 10. In the market economy as a
whole there is a positive result for private R &amp; D stocks and a
negative result for public R &amp; D stocks.</p>
<p>As Scobie and Eveleens have shown, there is a relationship
between R &amp; D annual expenditure over the long term and
productivity in AGR. Table 9 shows the relationship in this set of
data for the market economy and agriculture sectors using TFP as
the dependent variable. Since the individual elasticities are
additive the overall productivity effect of R &amp; D investment
can be assessed by this method. In both the market economy and
agriculture there is now an overall positive relation between
public R &amp; D and productivity. There is clearly a negative
relationship between the 4<sup>th</sup> and the 9<sup>th</sup> year
in public investment in both sectors which seems to be common to
most industries. Private investment in R &amp; D in AGR is positive
through the system reflecting the high elasticity and rate of
return obtained earlier.</p>

<p>The assumption that R &amp; D can be conveniently divided into
private and public providers can be challenged although the insight
it reveals is useful as the results so far show. Table 10
recalculates some of the main results for AGR with a variable
amalgamating the components of R &amp; D. By itself ALLR &amp; D is
strongly and positively related to changes in TFP. However its
strength of asociation is lost when regressed with AUST and EDU in
the same equation. Curiously the strongest relationship is that
with Australian stocks of R &amp; D. This is inconsistent with the
result in Table 6.</p>

<p>We next examine the source of R &amp; D knowledge employed in an
industry. We use the agricultural sector as an example. There are
two hypotheses to examine. We can ask whether the source of R &amp;
D knowledge is outside the immediate industry environs - in this
case such an effect could be called a spillover from one industry
to another. Secondly we can ask whether the additional source of R
&amp; D complements the R &amp; D already held or is a substitute
for it. We create two new variables; PVTOTHER and PUBOTHER; being
the stock of R &amp; D not designated as belonging to the AGR
science output area as defined by MoRST. We then create another
variable 'MULT' which is the geometric sum of the two stocks of
R &amp; D. A positive sign indicates complementarity and a negative
sign indicates substitution between own stocks and other stocks. In
Table 11, PVTOTHER is not quite significant at the 5% level and is
certainly of the right sign. PUBOTHER does not feature strongly. In
the case of MULT the coefficients are negative (indicating
substitution at work) but only that for PUBR &amp; D is significant
at the 5% level. Since PUBR &amp; D by itself has a negative
elasticity the MULT result amounts to reinforcing the negative
effect on TFP.</p>

<h2>Further Econometric Analysis</h2>
<p>A more sophisticated approach to the structure of returns in the
science system, using the same set of data, is to treat the
sectoral data as a cross-section panel (Johnson, Razzak &amp;
Stillman, 2005). This gives a 9x37 set of observations. The
function was assumed Cobb Douglas and the data normalised by
dividing throughout by the labour variable. Hence the results can
be interpreted as factors which affect labour productivity across
sectors in the economy. This variable enters the estimating
equation on the RHS as output per person lagged by one year and is
statistically significant. The response to capital per employee is
variable and not significant in every specification explored. The
results tend to support a constant returns to scale hypothesis.
Across industries, the elasticity of private R &amp; D stocks is
positive in all regressions tried, but the own effect of public R

&amp; D stocks is negative and barely significant. Spillovers were
tested by including each industry R &amp; D stock as an independent
variable. This measures the effect of a given industry stock on all
other industries. For private R &amp; D there were measurable
spillovers from building, forestry and services and for public R
&amp; D smaller spillovers from the agriculture and transport
industries.</p>
<p>These results confirm the simpler statistical models where
private R &amp; D has a small positive impact on own-industry
output after controlling for capital and labout inputs, and some
evidence that this R &amp; D spills over from certain industries to
the overall economy. Publicly provided R &amp; D does not appear to
have a positive impact on either own-industry output or the overall
economy. These results are consistent with economic theory in the
sense that private R &amp; D investments should be more efficient
as private firms will not undertake such investments unless they
expect a positive return. On the other hand, publicly provided R

&amp; D often has goals beyond profit maxmisation. (op cit,
p.11).</p>
<h2>Cost-benefit Studies</h2>
<p>Table 12 shows the results of cost-benefit studies on a project
basis undertaken by FRST. While these may be possibly
'successful' projects, they have longer track records that
permit evaluation. The results are generally very favourable. It is
not clear to me whether the methodology is always the same in each
case study. There is a need to be clear about private returns and
social returns to investment and whether national income
conventions are being observed. We should look forward to more of
these evaluations.</p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The results obtained by myself and Johnson <i>et al</i> are
drawn from a single set of data. Some of the R &amp; D data is
drawn from surveys in the period from 1989 to 2000, while some of
the R &amp; D data is extrapolated from less reliable sources for
the earlier period. National income, labour employment, and capital
stock are drawn from the data base set up by B. P. Philpott which
is consistent for the whole period of study. The allocation of R

&amp; D expenditure to a particular industry relies on the MoRST
system of 'science output areas' where providers try to
identify the probable users of that research. Before 1989, public
expenditure on R &amp; D was gleaned from Government and NRAC
records and the industry allocation depended on the department
carrying it out. For private expenditure on R &amp; D the
allocation was roughly in line with that found in 1989.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the association between R &amp; D expenditure
and particular industries is weak in the data. The set for the
market economy is stronger in this sense because these allocation
errors are avoided. The difference between the results for PVR
&amp; D and PUR &amp; D in both studies appears to be partly due to
these measurement errors and partly due to a conceptual difference
associated with the aim of scientific research. The latter is
perhaps best encapsulated in the notion of short-term versus
long-term investment strategies. The state, perhaps, has set
scientific objectives, in the past, that aimed at the national good
in a longer term framework. The results of such research permeate
into society rather slowly and unevenly. It may be virtually
unmeasurable! On the other hand, we would expect private enterprise
to invest in areas where there was a forseeable gain for them.
(This is pure hypothesis of course, given the measurement errors in
'science output areas').</p>
<p>The analysis does demonstrate, I think, that it is the general
pool of knowledge which is important in the economic utilisation of
scientific research rather than any special designated research.
Maybe we should stop looking for spillovers (between industries
say) and accept that knowledge is a general resource available to
anyone apart from where particular patents or ownership
restrictions apply. It might be important to bear in mind Griliches
(1979) definition where he says <q>The level of productivity
achieved by one firm or industry depends not only on its own
research efforts but also on the level of the pool of general
knowledge accessible to it</q>.</p>
