<h1>Comment on E.K.Bensah's Review of the UNCTAD Report on Commodity Dependence.</h1>
<p class="by">By</p>
<p class="by">Robin Johnson</p>

<p>I enjoyed Emmanuel&acute;s review of the UNCTAD
report <i>Trade Performance and Commodity Dependence </i>sent out on February
23 of this year from ICDA (wto.forum@yahoogroups.com). I have long had a
concern that the commodity trade could be a life saver for the economies of
Africa south of the Sahara (SSA). My views were formed when I was an economist
in the UK colonial service in the late 1950s and when I was a lecturer at the
University of Zimbabwe in the the mid 1960s. At that time the economies of West
Africa were enjoying considerable prosperity from trade in cocoa beans, palm
oil, groundnuts and cotton. In Central Africa it was tobacco and meat and in
East Africa it was cotton, sisal and tea. I notice in the UNCTAD report that
the commodity mix is not greatly changed - cocoa in Cote d&acute;Ivoire and Ghana,
cotton in Mali and Zimbabwe, coffee in Cote d&acute;Ivoire and Ethiopia, tobacco in
Zimbabwe and Malawi, sugar in Mauritius and Swaziland, tea in Kenya, and meat
in Botswana and Namibia. Behind these trade figures lies a vast area of mainly
savannah Africa devoted to smallholder subsistence agriculture which produces
cash crops as a surplus to its basic producing activities. It is the welfare of
these smallholders that I would like to comment on in this note to Emmanuel.</p>



<p>The report by UNCTAD on African trade
performance and commodity dependence raises a number of issues, <i>inter alia,</i>
about the slow development of smallholder agriculture in Africa south of the
Sahara. One of the positive legacies of colonial administration of African
territories, Belgian, French and British, was a system of well-established
agricultural research centres and extension bodies aimed at improving the performance
of small farmers in the wider savannah areas dependent on rain-fed agricultural
production. Some of these establishments are still in place and working to the
same broad ethic of farming systems improvement.</p>


<p>Agriculture in this region is characterised
by small holdings (commonly less than 5ha), family labour, and a lack of
mechanisation. Principal foodcrops vary from zone to zone; cassava in the
forest, and maize and sorghums in the savannah. Cash crops, interplanted or
sown separately, are cotton, groundnuts and in the wetter areas coffee and
cocoa and palm oil. Male out-migration is a characteristic of this region and
the majority of farm cultivation is performed by women and children. Normally
there is a short rain season around which planting is based, though in East
Africa there are two short rain seasons with some specialisation of crops
suited to each. The livestock economy tends to be separate from the
agricultural economy though the benefits of manure application where available
are well understood by smallholders.</p>



<p>These agricultural systems are in a
delicate balance with nature. They can be seriously disrupted by drought and
storms. The recent experience in Dafur shows that such systems are also badly
disturbed by a breakdown in security and governance.</p>



<p>Out of these agricultural systems in
savannah Africa surplusses have been derived from cash crops. Individual
countries have their speciality exports depending on climate and soils and
historic circumstances. Cocoa beans and coffee beans are mainly grown in the
forest zones; cotton in the drier
savannah; tobacco in east and central Africa high savannah; sugar in areas where water is available; tea
in east African highlands; and meat in the dry areas of southern Africa.</p>


<p>The UNCTAD report notes that most African countries have been losing market shares
in commodity exports to other non-African developing countries, while at the
same time most have been unable to diversify into manufactured exports.
Africa's difficulties in maintaining market shares for its traditional
commodities are stated to derive from its inability to overcome structural
constraints and modernise its agricultural sector, combined with the high cost
of trading.</p>



<p>Africa's difficulties in breaking into
trade in market-dynamic products is also related to significant changes that
have occurred in recent years in international trade in agricultural products
the report stresses. World trade has shifted from traditional commodity exports
to non-traditional ones such as fruits, vegetables, fish and seafood, which
have a high income elasticity and lower rates of protection in industrial and
large developing countries. Africa's lack of response is said to reflect an
inability to tap into cheaper finance, efficient logistics, and increased
capital resources and skills. Problems also arise in meeting sanitary and
phytosanitary requirements in importing countries for food exports.</p>


<p>UNCTAD identifies that institutional
capacity should be built up in research, provision of public goods, quality
improvement, production adjustment and diversification of the product mix. The
stress in research is on market intelligence rather than Research and Development <i>per se</i>
but the general point is made that a policy of diversification will not succeed
without adequate back-up research. The public goods identified are market
research, infrastructure development and handling services and processses for
the export industry.</p>


<p>UNCTAD also sees scope for expanding
regional economic cooperation and integration in SSA. Greater coordination in
customs procedures, reducing tariffs and non-tariff barriers and improving
transport and communications could be achieved through the New Partnership for
Africa's Development (NEPAD). Opportunities exist for intra-regional trade in food
items such maize, cassava and fish as well as in live animals and bovine meat.</p>


<p>Market access could be improved by
concessions from OECD countries and also by the steady movement of competitors
like Asia and Latin America out of commodity markets. Compensation for
subsidy-related income losses relates to a proposal by the President of Burkino
Faso for protectionist countries to pay African cotton producers for income
losses arising out of domestic crop subsidies. Compensatory financing
mechanisms might be possible during
commodity price slumps if suitable arrangements could be set up in advance. ODA
could be directed to improving human and physical infrastructure and
institution building to help toward a steady and sustained diversification
programme in Africa.</p>


<p>I note, along with other commentators, that
the UNCTAD prescription has shifted away from the free market model of
development in vogue since the 1980s. They now recognise that the needed
infrastructure for product and market development will only be accomplished
with Government guidance and assistance. The burden is too great for small
scale producers. Some of the development and quality assurance functions of the
old marketing boards need re-inventing. ODA could be directed at this kind of
objective.</p>


<p>I feel the report is less sure on the
problems of smallholder agriculture. There is no assessment of the widespread
Research and Development network of research stations and international aid by the likes of
CIGAR. There is no assessment of staffing levels and skills in the extension
arms of the various Ministries of Agriculture. There is no assessment of the
potential of African farming systems apart from odd remarks about the plentiful
supply of land. And no assessment of resource restrictions like water and
service industries. All these would be involved in any diversification and new
product development programme as well as competition from food crops.</p>
<p>My former colleague, John R Raeburn, previously at the University of Aberdeen, asks in a letter where are the people with the necessary understanding of the &lsquo;grass roots&rsquo; and the disciplined
understanding of new opportunities? High on his list would be the establishment
of sound Colleges with effective extension services, the study of farming
financial needs and possibilities, and outlook work. &ldquo;And perhaps above all is
needed an understanding on the part of aid policy makers of manual labour on
tropical farms and what intermediate technology and well-organised mechanical
services could feasibly do&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In our view, a new balance is needed in the
nature of the labour supply. The dependence on women has been shown by FAO to be a considerable restricting factor in
improved productivity. In the past, the rewards from urban employment
(including estates) have tended to be <i>additional</i> to the rewards/income
derived from smallholder agriculture. Quite a large improvement in cash crop
income would be needed to compensate for this source of income. Education for
women may be a better strategy in the long run especially if urban wages rise
too fast.</p>
